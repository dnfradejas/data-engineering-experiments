Chocolate Hills,Batuan,,Bohol,,,,"Included in the UNESCO World Heritage Natural Monuments list, the Chocolate Hills of Bohol are a geomorphic wonder and truly a sight to behold. It is one of the best places in the Philippines to offer a unique landscape, with its 1,268 cone-shaped hills that turn chocolatey brown during the dry season, hence its name.","We have already seen the chocolate hills while we were on the way to, I guess, the highest peak among all of them. You are gonna climb all the way to the top of it so you could see a 360 degrees of the Chocolate Hills. It was exhausting to climb all the way to the top and my 65 year old mom wasn't even able to make it to the top. There were benches on the side of the steps tho if you can't go all the way to the top and there you could still appreciate the beauty of the Chocolate Hills.",,,Hills,2000000.0,50
Hanging Bridge,Tagbilaran,,Bohol,,,,"Over the years, the bridge, which was was originally made with woven bamboo, has received some safety reinforcements due to its popularity with tourists. Not to worry though, it still creeks and swings and gives you butterflies in your stomach as you look down at the rushing river below you.","We absolutely loved this site, it was a great source of amusement watching people get their flip flops stuck, and gripping hold of the sides as it wobbled we actually went twice as some other guests at our resort wanted to see it when we told them about it. The story behind the bridge was also very interesting.",,,Bridge,,80
