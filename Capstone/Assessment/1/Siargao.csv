Cloud 9,General Luna,,Siargao,,,,"Siargaoâ€™s rise as a top tourist spot in the Philippines is nothing short of meteoric. Once a sleepy island in Surigao del Norte, it has become one of the favorite destinations and playgrounds for travelers, and it is primarily because of one activity: surfing.","Price of admission is very low, but it's time to overhaul the entire construction. It's a good place to watch the surfers, and a good entry point if you are going surfing or snorkeling.",,,Surfing,,None
