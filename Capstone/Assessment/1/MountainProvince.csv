Hanging Coffins,Sagada,Echo Valley,Mountain Province,,,,"It is a trek to get to the hanging coffins in Sagada, located deep in the northern Cordillera Mountains, but the sight is something most people in the world will never see. The hanging coffins, some centuries old, are suspended from the cliffs of the Echo Valley. These ceremonial burials were reserved for the wealthy tribesmen.",I've been to this place and going there you'll a a cemetery going down the hill and up. I was already very exhausted since we just came from bumod ok falls. but when you reach the place wow! i can't believe Ive been in this place since i just saw it from magazines and movies. place looks scary because its only us who went there and its already late in the afternoon around 5:00pm.,,,,,300
