The room was spacious and clean, service crew is very accommodating and food was okay. Though windows are closed, which I would suggest to leave it open as good ventilation is also necessary. Placing a microwave inside the room for heating food is also suggested since the person under quarantine is not allowed to go out or request this service from the hotel.

The first time we booked, my Lola was denied entry in Japan where her connecting flight to Manila is. Privato Ortigas was understanding enough to rebook our reservation up to the next month until my Lola got another flight to Manila. When she stayed in the hotel, she complimented how nice and clean the room is. They also helped her to process her permit to entry in Baguio and was kind enough to book for a Grab (special thanks to Ms. Angela Buenaventura!).  I highly recommend this place especially during these tough times when you feel like most might take advantage of the situation to earn more as well as to make it as an excuse to give crappy service. We didn't feel any of this with Privato",paulsan730,My first impression wasn‚Äôt too good as the service seemed pedestrian (got better with time) and rooms were small. My experience started getting better when I took in the view of the city. And the rooftop pool next to the gym was very relaxing. Food was very good too. I‚Äôll recommend this hotel.,George,Rooms are clean and very comfortable. It is also well-lit and well-maintained. I was just surprised that the double rooms vary in room sizes (I stayed with a bigger one on my first stay than my second stay).,kenwynferrer,"Had an early booking for our mini-moon, that's why we had a free availment of late check out. :) They also put a little welcome gift for us (per request). The ambiance is very chill and we had a very relaxing stay. That was our second time at the hotel, and we're still loving the roof deck with a view and little alcohol. Would definitely come back. The place is near Capitol Commons and Estancia Mall. :) Thank you!",GelaCat,"That gay-looking guy in a khaki suit was so obnoxious and that tiny girl in a gray or similar khaki office uniform was equally incompetent! With the slow and unstable internet at the hotel Lobby, you'd be disco√πraged to use Agoda.com or any other hotel booking app to get a fairly affordable room at this hotel. I use agoda most of the time because the room rates at Privato Ortigas are too high for their measly facilities and service! When their wifi didn't work for me, I used my phones data to connect and boy was it so difficult to get a stable connection - y√≤u can't get a decent 4g connection within the premises I don't know why!!!   I should have just stayed at Red Planet Hotel Ortigas!!!",Dream566459,Excellent service from front desk to room service.

Everytime I was in the lift it was full of staff giggling away stopping in all 22 floors. They should use the stairs instead of annoying guests.",gordonshawid,"We managed our expectations coming into Privato knowing that it‚Äôs a 3-star budget hotel. The place is made for no frills, business stays - not for any romantic or relaxing getaway. This should come as a fair warning to couples. Bathroom is bare, with minimal toiletries. Facilities are so so and food at their restaurant is passable, while the ambiance is very businesslike.  What was irksome during our stay were several inconveniences which could have been handled better by management. Firstly, 1 out of only 2 elevators were out of service. Second, we experienced power fluctuations not once but twice, waking us in the middle of the night to a hot room. The second time it happened, reception was unresponsive to our calls to fix the power in our room. Overall, service could have",Louise,I do appreciate the help from Contesa. She is really lovely and helpful. The staff from the restaurant so amazing ! Rooms can be improved to make them fell more familiar but is enough for someone who wants to have a very comfortable stay,Luis Fernando A,"Breakfast buffet has a few choices. Only one we had with mo bacon. Perhaps instead of adobo, bacon instead. Enjoyed the pool because it‚Äôs shallow. Double Deluxe Room is a little tiny though. Over all, experience is thumbs up.",MayaAS68,"My 8th times vacation stay since 2015 at Privato Hotel Shaw was really fantastic. What I really enjoyed was the Rooftop View deck and Verona bar which is my favorite place.

So I booked a room and made reservations at Privato Ortigas' Verona Roofdeck Bar.   I highly appreciate that the Privato placed a limit of 70 guests at the said bar for safety reasons. In this way, we were able to view the skyline comfortably without having to nudge other people for a nice spot. Everybody got nice videos and photos of the fireworks-filled sky that night :).

I got so confused, I should have only given 2 vouchers for me and my husband then paid 300 for our kid. I even remember telling the lady there that there's only 3 of us but I guess she didn't bother coz she's also dazed and confused with the many people. It's just sad, it's supposed to be a relaxing place.",Laura D
