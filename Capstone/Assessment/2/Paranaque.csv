This is the type of hotel you only use if your flight is canceled and you want to be near the airport for an early morning flight instead of risking going deeper into Manila where traffic will cause you to be late for your rescheduled flight.  They absolutely gouge you for money.  You'll need a deposit if you want a second key for your spouse.

Straight up looking at me up and down. There is a $10 refundable cash only deposit they didn‚Äôt mention prior to booking. There‚Äôs 1 outlet in the room, across the room not near the bed. Prior to arriving I asked about the laundry facility, they do have BUT they do the laundry for you. Ok no worries. What they did not mention was that it is only during certain times and it takes 24 HOURS to RETURN your clothes. The showers are decent, the water is warm. They also have a shuttle bus to and from the airport and that was not mentioned when booking. The only good thing about this hotel is that the room was super clean.",Viris,"This Hotel offered a nice and clean room that wasn‚Äôt too noisy. The AC worked well even though it actually was a little bit too noisy, but since we were tired from our flight we slept very well anyways.  The Coffeeshop downstairs offered a decent breakfast included in the room price, but for dinner I would suggest you to go somewhere else, since the food was a little pricey and not tasty at all.  The Rooms are a little expensive, but only for Phillipine standards.  Don‚Äôt forget to make use of their easy Shuttle service from and to the airport. We only learnt about this when we had already paid an overpriced taxi at the airport.  WIFI was good.",Emil K,"I stayed at this hotel due to a cacelled flight from Nimoy Aquino  for one night.

The cab driver tried to bring me to another hotel (Siayan), but I told him to take me to this one instead due to the advertised lower price.   Zen Rooms Nichols Airport Hotel's biggest problem is that it's too expensive.  I had already spent a week in downown Manila at the MANILA GRAND OPERA HOTEL (my favorite) which had a great room, a swimming pool and the rate was around HALF THE PRICE.

Breakfast was ok but pricey.  Very close to the airport which was a plus for me.  Area in which the hotel is located is a bit scary.,roj1281,Good hotel for overnight airport stopover checkin was fast. We stayed in room 477 which is spacious and heaps of room to store plenty of luggage. Room was clean the only thing I was disappointed in was the price of drinks and food way over priced for the quality of the food my daughter had Carbonara and she said all she could taste was cheese my wife said hers was tasteless and I had adobo so tasteless and so dry all portions were so very small land food was delivered cold see attached photos for prices and add the VAT and service charge makes it well over priced a San Miguel light was 75 peso plus VAT and SC. and not that cold.This is from the roof top bar which is not that well done and hot no cooling. In finishing stay for the hotel but don't eat or drink there.,Malcolm505,"Clean, and comfortable. Breakfast overpriced and disappointing. But the most disappointing part is my husband opted for the hotel massage, only to be propositioned to pay for sex.

She was pretty helpful however today was her day to rest  So she endorsed us to another Malaysian Manager with surname of Kok/Kwok. Joan called the manager and of course Tina/Dina asked us to look for him, we do asked Joan to asked him. im not sure how a Manager should react when the guest called them but this Manager was really provided as bad impression as a MANAGER.He waljwd away when we still asking him questions as he was busy with other thing.

We only got a service when one of us started winning so that can be improved.,Nelea Charisse T,City of Dreams is an 'integrated resort' that includes three 5 star hotels plus a wide range of retail and restaurants and other leisure and gaming availability all under one roof.,Rory James DOYLE,"City of Dreams is a complex of three hotels, casino, and numerous restaurants.  We stayed at all three hotels.  The Hyatt was the oldest of the three, the least expensive, and the most crowded.  We had a unattractive street and city view with a swampy parking lot below filled with strange milky looking water.  On the plus side there was a nice pool area, great shower, good air conditioning, comfortable double beds, lots of towels in the bathroom, and a night light.  Put your room card in the slot by the door to turn on the lights. We did not see complimentary water and the water price was hidden in the drawer.  There is no ice bucket or ice machine.  We ordered some ice from room service that came in a bowl.  Toiletries were in an ugly little box on counter.  They do offer a free shuttle to Mall of Asia that runs from 11:00 am until 2:00 am.  There was a small fruit platter with an apple, orange and pear.  No plate with knife and fork. We went online to book a room for an additional night though we just needed it for a few hours before a late flight.  We saw online that there was space available.  My husband went downstairs to book the room and was told to go back to his room and dial 0.  He did and was told to go downstairs.  Also because we booked the first room online through a third party (hotels.com) the Hyatt did not count our stay as part of their frequent visitor program.  Our second room was nicer and larger than the first with a garden view.  The lobby was extremely smoky and disorganized.  Casino is extremely busy Friday and Saturday nights. Luckily we met a very nice representative at the airport.  He was the best thing about the hotel.  He helped arrange our transport to and from the hotel and waited with us at the airport until we were safely aboard the shuttle.  Note of all three hotels at City of Dreams the Hyatt had the lowest airport transportation $50 US versus $80 US from Nobu.  Decent accommodations.  Ask for a garden view.",Kathleen H,"This buffet has it all. Seafood, Filipino food, casual food. Atmosphere is nice and quiet enough to have good conversations. ",Henry S,various food stores - local and international; plus nice shops and stores selling interesting items - trinkets to the pricey items like jewelry and time pieces,ShuKat,"This is amongst the CASINOS Newly established in Manila. The Casino is Average as compared to the others established about the same time and around the same area. The gaming facilities are limited, so are the floor space and the numbers of gaming tables and varities, as compared to the other Casinos. It is surprising , as the JV Owner is one of the KEY Casino operators in MACAU !!! The shops within is also not too exciting and quite limited. Not many eateries around the complex as well. Service standard can also be improved. Visit it for the sake of HAVE BEEN !!!",313globetrotter,Not a lot of selection for places to eat. Casino is okay. Limited shops due to the limited space. Free parking.,Travel Kings,"I came here January 2020 to meet up with local family. BEWARE this casino is ghetto, with people watching you & your machine. And the smoke is terrible. My aunt is elderly & handicapped. She was sitting in a machine where the entire row was empty. She lost all her money & was waiting for the rest of the group. Employees told her to get up and leave, and that those machines are for paying players. Uhhh...duhh she was playing but lost because all your machines suck! Will never return here. You should be ashamed!!!!",ed M,A very nice structure inside and out. Having a lot of entertainments like casino dreamplay and a lot of restaurants and cafe inside,@va17ess,"Went there for the casino and had our dinner there. The casino is two storey and huge. As I wasn't a smoker, I felt that the place was too smoky and left me with a headache. Drinks are all free, I will recommend the hot chocolate if you're feeling cold. Quite a number of people all trying their luck at the various tables, and even if you're not a gambler, you can people-watch which is rather interesting. A handful of restaurants there, and a food area where there are about 7 food trucks that food is priced cheaper than eating at the restaurants.",SephRB,I have played here several times.Nice placeBut there's alot of foreigners like Chinese playing and smoking.And I never win anything here. Unlike okada and solaire where I win. ,Bernice Sim,"We  had a pleasant stay in the City of Dreams. The hotel has a casino, a variety of choices to shop at and eat in, that you never need to leave its premises, despite it also being near to SM MOA. Room was clean, bed confortable. We had a few not-so-good experiences, but overall, it was pleasant.",Mark Evangelista PWD,"I have a few things to point out.  The brief stay was good and not so good in some aspects which I will write below and let you decide The GOOD:Hotel room, amenities and view - Great! Service - friendly and accommodating staff who assisted us during check-in; even gave my wife a bday cake to celebrate the occasionRestaurants - the food truck park was a hit with all of and offers you variety of food and drinks, some of our favorite dishes were available and allowed my wife and I to try a couple of new restaurantsPool area and gardens - quite nice to stroll and walk around, it was drizzling but I really liked the use of spaceThe NOT-SO-GOOD:- going to and from the food park to the hotel, you have to walk around the casino area where the smell of smoke was nauseating and I was actually surprised people were walking with small kids and even infants in strollers around this area.  Health hazard (funny that the NO SMOKING sign was quite visibly posted on the pillars around the casino floor :)- my son and I wanted to go for a swim, usually my son wears his board shorts and a dri-fit shirt which the pool attendants had to verify with me since it is quite fitting for my son who was on the chubby side that it could be mistaken for a rashguard, the material was almost similar - however, they only allow rashguard attire or barenaked for men.  Disappointed, my son and I just decided to forego the swim and walked back up to the room.  Take note of this to avoid disappointment- I was not satisfied with the number of food choices in the breakfast buffet.  The reason I did not gave this review a POOR rating, the staycation was still fun and quite memorable because of the people you spend it with.  All the rest are extra!",remicharlene,"You know, I want to go out of my way to say just how awesome this place is! My wife and I just got back from a two night trip and I can't say enough about the Resorts World Manila. Huge casino. Awesome slots. So many slots actually. Comparable to Las Vegas in quantity in that regard. But the best thing for me was the casino staff. I had a few drinks on my last night and was high fiving and cheering at the baccarrat tables and I wasnt obnoxious or anything, but I was loud and energetic. All the dealers were cool with me and therefore I tipped from time to time.The hotel security never once came over to tell me to keep it down and I mention this because there have been a lot of reviews suggesting that the casino security is heavy handed. ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. They were great. They let me have fun, win or lose. Also there are so many amazing restaurants both at the casino level and in the mall. You simply don't need to leave the place. I loved it. Kudos to the staff and management. Definitely this is my first choice for casino action in Asia. Why? Because it's so much fun. Thanks Resorts World. I will be back soon.",Mao M,"what a wonderful place to visit - from the excellent gardens and pool area to the restaurants and entertainment - such as the Entertainment complex with Virtual reality games and the Dreamworks interactive play area to the many restaurants, shops and huge casinos. plenty to do, plenty to enjoy. Just one issue and that is that smoking is permitted in the Casinos- very disappointing",gardenbear,"My wife and I stay here when we want to be close to the airport. As a Hyatt rewards program member, we have always been given a complimentary suite upgrade. The Hotel has a casino, shopping, restaurants, and you never need to leave. It's not on a main street so getting a taxi can sometimes be a problem if leaving at very early or late hours.",kalboHastings - prolific reviewer

As Manila Bay‚Äôs crown jewel, Okada Manila is the newest and grandest gaming and entertainment destination in Asia. From its sinfully sumptuous suites and villas, to its award-winning cuisine prepared by expert chefs, to the region‚Äôs first indoor beach club, to the prestige brands on offer at its retail glass corridor.

The fountain stands as a monument to Okada Manila‚Äôs grand vision of building what will perhaps become one of the wonders of the modern world. Breaking new ground with its many distinct innovations, Okada Manila expertly combines advanced technology, top-class amenities, environment-friendly architectural planning, and world-class entertainment options‚Äîtopped with the kind of exemplary service that personifies a unique blend of Japanese hospitality and Filipino warmth.

We're about to take a dinner but they disturbed us and held me in a secluded office where everybody were just a male security guards for more than an hour. They didn't allowed my boyfriend to escort me inside and the head of security looks like a boasting maniac. They accused me for room selling when my other account was just hacked by a scammer. I understand what they are saying but at least they should investigate first before saying that I will be banned in the premises. I'm going to sue that security and make sure everyone will pay. That is harassment.",Blessie A,This will be my best hotel experience.  Staff members were courteous... I was amazed by the huge jacuzzi inside the room.  The only thing i missed is the swimming pool because it was closed due to pandemic.  Looking forward to come back again!,Kriss R,"It was truly a relaxing momeny. I got a chance to experience world-class spa. I truly admire the ambiance because it was so grand, expensive and peaceful.",Ivaylo Ivanov,"We had such an amazing experience staying at this hotel. Antigen testing was smooth and we were able to check in right after getting the results. The staffs are all nice and greets you whenever they see you. Our Executive Suite is super nice, and the view is really amazing. It's really worth it! Breakfast is also good, and we had it in-room since buffet is closed, but still loved it, and it's safer! They also surprised us with an anniversary banner and cake which is soooo sweet. Thank you so much, Okada for this lovely experience. We'll definitely come back and recommend you to our friends!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Elisa Fantillo,"With all of the COVID restrictions, my wife and I have not been able to take our 6-month-old son anywhere. We were very excited to learn that we could come to the Okada for a staycation! A lot of the restaurants and amenities are currently closed, including the fountain, but we still thoroughly enjoyed our stay!  From all of our inquiries before our stay to our arrival and throughout our stay, everything was wonderful.  We arrived to the incredibly helpful staff who valeted our car, took our luggage, and escorted us to the check-in desk. We completed COVID tests upon arrival, which were done very quickly.  We were then shown to our room, to which we found we were upgraded to an incredible suite, and our luggage arrived shortly after.  We had an issue with some of the lights in our unit not turning off the first night, but the problem was corrected the next day.  It was so nice to be able to walk around the property with our son.  Even sitting at the Starbucks felt like such a luxury!  The property did get crowded on Saturday and Sunday, with a lot of large events taking place and day guests coming to visit.  I will say that those guests do not require COVID tests, so it seems a little silly that you are required to have one only if you are spending the night.Nonetheless, our stay was wonderful and in particular, I would like to call out Timothy from the pool bar, Yussep from guest services, Rea from the concierge, Chris at the front door, and Jeffrey from guest services who all made our stay wonderful.  We hope to be back soon!",Ivaylo Ivanov,They‚Äôre good at surprises. Booked ahead of time for a 2-night stay to spend our first Valentine‚Äôs celebration as a married couple. All our booking requests which they confirmed and agreed to upon booking were ALL disregarded without any notice. Just found out that none were accommodated upon checking in to our room. What a surprise. I guess they‚Äôre living with they‚Äôre objective on making your experience memorable‚Äîin a bad way. Spent our first day just waiting for updates and follow ups.

Outstanding service (esp. Timothy) and the place is TOPS. We will soon be back. ",Ivaylo Ivanov,"My partner and I booked the Okada hotel for one night before our long haul flight the following day. Having travelled around for three weeks, we wanted a bit of luxury before returning to the UK; Okada did not deliver. Upon arrival we were surprised that our luggage was searched numerous times, but understood the need for security. We arrived at 5pm when our designated check-in was 3pm, to be advised our room was not yet ready. The receptionist began by saying we could use the spa or sit in the bar and wait. We were not offered any complementary treatments or even a drink, just simply told you will have to wait the room is not ready. After much back and forth we were told ten minutes to wait, which seemed slightly odd considering she had originally advised we go and get a spa treatment whilst we wait. The room itself was nice, however had a very strong smell of petrol fumes. We turned off the aircon unit but this made no difference. When we returned to the room and got into bed around midnight, I discovered a patch of blood on the sheet that had clearly not come from either of us. This explained why we were originally told the room was not ready, then it was suddenly ready within ten minutes. Quite clearly the bed sheets were not changed before our stay. We felt physically sick. This is utterly disgusting service from a '5*' hotel. We had to call house keeping to change the bed, and again we were not offered anything to compensate for such poor service. Would not recommend. ",Gel C,"I went to Okada. They did not let me enter with my backpack. I came from my layover flight and decided to go to casino to gamble. My backpack is a Gucci brand and it was 2000usd. I don't feel safe checking in my backpack, they want me to check in my backpack or else i cannot enter. I have my documents and many business credit cards and a small business laptop. I do not feel safe checking in my backpack. I want to carry it with me for peace of mind. It‚Äôs a small backpack. Why can't i enter? this is a very bad experience for me.

Kudos!!! Thank you okada!!!,Ivaylo Ivanov,"Every casino in the world, from las vegas to atlantic city, to monte carlo, to macau, to Resort World Manila allows customers to carry their backpack. It's common sense.Only Okada does not allow it. I goto casino, I carry valueables in my backpack; passport, credit cards, medicine pills, glasses, cash, high denomination chips, cellphones, chargers.After going to security scanner xray machine, and nothing malicious found, I goto the casino floor, but the security says ""no backpack allowed"" The security guard wanted me to ""check-in"" my backpack. I said, why would I check in my backpack? I have all my valueable items that I carry with me at all times. He says that I have to put my items in my pockets. So while I play baccarat or slot machine, I have 2 big cellphones in my jeans. my passport id will bend. This is uncomfortable. Security guard says backpack is allowed only if u have bundles of cash.so now every time I goto Okada, I have bundles of cash, just so I can enter. The security must see that cash. He wants to see. This is awkard and privacy invasive. So now if you see a person with a backpack in Okada, it means theyre carrying hundreds of thousands. It makes them a target (to be followed to parking etc). Do u see whats wrong here? Why does Okada make such rule? whats the purpose? why don't you have a meeting and re evaluate your protocols.thank u",Carol O,"Just went to view the Dancing Fountains, and it was fantastic.It's amazing how those fountains swing in tune with Aerosmith's ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing . . .""I think they have these shows every Christmas Season (have to check this). Better bring a really good video camera, with a zoom lens.",Ivaylo Ivanov,"Sometimes, it's the best things in Life that are Free. That's the impression one can get watching the Fountain Show at Okada Manila.Okada Manila's welcoming ambiance is expressed in its Pink Colors - definitely elegant and could never be mistaken for tacky. The hotel's layout design is best appreciated as it draws visitors to its attractions (immediately the Fountain Show) rather than building a crowd in its lounge/ reception area which is common for most hotels.  Exiting the hotel as well offers the same revelation - no throng of guests waiting to exit out albeit seemingly slow valet services.",FellowTraveler796017,"As far as entertainment & fun is what you've been looking for...this is the place to be. Nothing compares the ambiance, cozy and elegance on this place.... a nice spot to visit.",Eric john A,"I am a half korean/English/American but have pale skin obv I have the eyes. In Manila I was asked may times a day if I was Filipino which I wouldn‚Äôt mind, but shocked cause growing up it would always be Chinese Japanese korean never Once. I might be used to Las Vegas right professionalism when it comes to taking bet paying out chips in cash etc. where am I going. I‚Äôm 32 I could pass for 21 I felt like there‚Äôs a misconception that a young person like me doesn‚Äôt have that much money or they think I‚Äôm Filipino or white. As a dealer when I sat down was very nice prob my age was in shock I obv don‚Äôt look like the avg Asian as he said. He said I know your Asian but it‚Äôs like your white I never seen this before. Also the guards getting in were rude it was like they were told to try and give attitudes to people they feel don‚Äôt have money so they won‚Äôt come back. I swear changing into a nice button down expensive jeans i saw a difference. I carried a bag man purse guard looks in and my passport 5000 usd and 100,000 peso stack. Attitude changed. More things seem to confirm it when I go back as I‚Äôm staying at resorts world I was coming for poker game then would gamble. No one was in line to go through metal detectors and I stand there unzip my bag and instead of the swift hand upfront  and back not touching far out to see bulge and used stick. And she gave me this attitude out of nowhere and nudge me i only went inch but she check by back side again and it‚Äôs her angry face. Now I‚Äôm saved by a guard who saw my money previous day and she tells the guard to stop it‚Äôs ok and looks down smiling. I only game there cuz there was poker action which even the floors managers will tell you it was because of me regulars showed up. There is something in Filipino culture or the casino wants to keep a certain kind of person out as I didn‚Äôt want special treatment but so many rude  responses to simple questions. It might be they don‚Äôt realize they are not only in service industry but an industry where people are losing Money. This is a complaint as a whole not complaining about specific person etc. I will be returning and would love to play poker there but also take breaks and play 100,000 php at baccarat then go back as playing poker even though it‚Äôs raked out of principle I couldn‚Äôt lose money to people being rude.  I also would never complain about a person and have there job possibly in harm but what recourse does any employee from okada suggest I do if I‚Äôm getting these nasty vibes from floor men dealers. What is funny my personality is the type to go get 1million pesos and walk right in front of the guy that was rude to me. But I‚Äôm Las Vegas it‚Äôs easier with $20,000 usd then 1million pesos.  I wanted to end with some sarcasm and I don‚Äôt want anything don‚Äôt need anything but I‚Äôd like to hear from an employee because these casinos were built specifically for a certain race/culture and high rollers I know real high rollers and I didn‚Äôt see any I saw 10,000 peso max bet tables. I‚Äôll stop im just upset because minus the interaction I like the layout over  Solaire besides there suites there casino is nothing special.‚ÄôOkada was built great and I‚Äôd like to play there. Hopefully there‚Äôs a response with in 2 weeks. I fly in korean airlines Ny business if you wanna send a car? Kidding.",Ivaylo Ivanov

Familiar also with every menu from the menu book (even to its taste and how it is presented)and to specialties of every resto- waterside, yakumi, finestra etc. Ask me anything even to the performances of each employee, or if the room was turned down, to the paper, pencil and greeting letter at the table of each room by its VP, to the taste & price of every dish in the food court. So familiar even to the hotel's scents, bottled water taste, to brand of its pillows and if sauna is working or under repair.. If this is an exam, I will surely get a 100% grade.

The room was amazing, the housekeeping personnel was helpful and alert. (I forgot her name lol ). The buffet at Fresh was delicious. Nice sunset view at the pool. I want also to commend all the pool staff esp to Michael he was very welcoming, accomodating and approachable (beyond expectations).Will surely comeback this year! Thank you for the wonderful experience. Happy 2020 Solaire Team.",Paradise35141352471,"Last January 7 (between 5-7pm), I was shopping in the G/F at the Sky Tower of Solaire (building annex connected to Solaire Main Hotel) when suddenly I saw some management staff plus firemen carrying extinguishers rushing to the elevator. When I (with other shoppers/employers) was trying to access the elevator to go to parking, they blocked us off and said the elevators are temporarily not accessible. So naturally, I proceeded to the FIRE EXIT to make my way to 3/F, a security lady blocked me and asked me to stay in the G/F. Worried, I was asking security what is happening some would say-1. ""we cannot confirm""2. ""Secret""3. Fire broke out in one of the floors4. "" stay inside foe your safety"" FIRE?!?!?! If it did, then WHY DID I NOT HEAR any fire alarms? And Why are we not allowed to access the FIRE EXIT???After 30mins of waiting within the lobby area. Security was directing us to go outside, at the docking area of the Sky Tower Building. Again, I still dont hear fire alarms.Slowly, I see building employees (of companies renting in the SKY Tower as all would have building IDs. BUT notable, i did not see hotel and casino guests being evacuated. You can see in the video below majority would have building IDs.While outside, they just asked us to wait. NO security marshalls and no building staff announcing any general advise regarding the matter. And no directions or lines being instructed for us to follow, which I am expecting from a 5 star hotel building. I saw some young folks who are trying to video the moment and I security swarming towards them asking videos to be deleted. They were even shouting and threatening one yound lady that theyd bring her to security office and BAN HER in Solaire hotel and casino.Then firetrucks begin to arrive. Hmmm and they still wont divulge what is happening?!?!?Thoughts on this-1. If THIS WERE a fire drill. Why wasnt there an alarm triggered? Why was evacuation being selective? And if it were a fire drill, sorry to say but super bad handling.2. If there was really fire? Even small and on one floor only, why wasnt there any alarms triggered to the WHOLE BUILDING3. What if it worsened? Is that only time you will trigger the alarm4. Why were we not ALLOWED to use FIRE EXITShortly afrer 7pm, they allowed us to go out. Sharing some pics below",Jay A
