Simply board a tricycle, and tell the driver you'd like to go to Bonbon Beach. There are now flights from Manila to Tablas Island, Romblon, your next gateway to the beach.","The resort was very hidden, but it also meant that it was quiet :). Food was very nice and the people very friendly. Room was clean, but the shower was flooded so we had to wait a fair bit before the next person could shower. Only stayed there for one night but very nice for the price",,,,,
