Bayugin Falls,Bulusan,,Sorsogon,,,,"Visitors in Bulusan flock to the Bulusan Volcano National Park, but not many make it to Bayugin Falls. It's a small waterfall, but the water is very cold and refreshing, especially on a hot and humid day.To get there, drive or take a tricycle up to Bgy. San Francisco. Admission fee is only 15 pesos per guest, vehicle parking costs 20 pesos, and cottages can be rented for 150 pesos.",The waterfall is hard to reach. We had to park at a community center and then walk to the falls. We followed a trail that went way way down to the falls. There are bamboo handrails in some parts but not all the way. One has to be very careful because the path is slippery due to the moss on the ground. Bring some snacks because there are no shops/stores in the area. Reward yourself with a dip in the refreshing and cool waters after walking that far!,,,Falls,,15
