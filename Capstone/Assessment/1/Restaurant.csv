Summer Palace,Mandaluyong,Shangrila,NCR,Chinese,N/A,70,"Lunch, Dinner","I have tried eating here for lunch on a Sunday on two separate occassions. Both times the waiters were too busy. There were just too many customers. Some food that we ordered didn't arrive. Taste seems to be declining. We asked for the dimsum food cart 4 times before it arrived. Tips: make a reservation before going, eat on a weekday for dinner. Avoid weekends."
Eng Bee Tin,Manila,Binondo,NCR,Chinese,N/A,25,"Lunch, Dinner",This is your go to place for that good ube (Purple yam) or munggo (Mung Beans) hopia (local pastry with fillings). The staff are always very helpful also explaining to you the expiry and the way to keep your bought goodies. They also serve some hot snacks at the front of the shop to satisfy your quick tummy fixes. The only problem is parking if you are going there with your car. It is a challenge if you are alone.
