Bonbon Beach,Romblon,,Romblon,,,,"Bonbon Beach in Romblon has fine, white sand, clear waters and a beautiful view. I first learned about Bonbon from another travel blog and decided to visit when I was in the province. Luckily, there werenâ€™t too many people around! Make sure to wait until sunset so you get to see the sky turn into variants of red and orange before getting dark. The beach is easily accessible by public transport from the town. Simply board a tricycle, and tell the driver you'd like to go to Bonbon Beach. There are now flights from Manila to Tablas Island, Romblon, your next gateway to the beach.","Beach by itself is very nice, but old woman, Grace, owner of the guesthouse claimed the beach, trained many aggressive dogs to keep tourists off. She usually let them go to the beach sometimes, so I was bitten by this dogs and had to do antirabies injections. Hope one day this beach will be taken of the dogs and returned to the people of Romblon. Just imagine how it is dangerous for kids, but unfortunately she seems to has informal relationship with barangay secretary and local police, as they refused to accept my report",,,Beach Resort,,None
