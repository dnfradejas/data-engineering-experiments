Rizal Park,Manila,Ermita,NCR,Park,1800000,50,Many travelers skip Manila and make their way to the Philippines' other islands but a day or two in the country’s capital to go on Manila tours is still highly recommended.,In my own opinion when you say Philippines it's automatic that the next word or person that you may link to it after the word Manila is Rizal. We can say that Philippines is Rizal and Rizal is Philippines.

On this homestay hike we trekked for 19 km the first day to Cambulo, and the children sang and danced traditional songs/dances for us- they were wonderful! Everyone knows Robert as he is local, friendly, has served on the Tourism Board and is excellent at explaining, dancing, demonstrating the various cultural practices.

Cloud 9,General Luna,N/A,Siargao,Surfing,N/A,None,"Siargao’s rise as a top tourist spot in the Philippines is nothing short of meteoric. Once a sleepy island in Surigao del Norte, it has become one of the favorite destinations and playgrounds for travelers, and it is primarily because of one activity: surfing.","Price of admission is very low, but it's time to overhaul the entire construction. It's a good place to watch the surfers, and a good entry point if you are going surfing or snorkeling."
Puerto Princesa Underground River,Puerto Princesa,N/A,Palawan,River,1200000,500,"The gateway to the Philippines’ Last Frontier, Palawan, is its capital Puerto Princesa.

Chocolate Hills,Batuan,N/A,Bohol,Hills,2000000,50,"Included in the UNESCO World Heritage Natural Monuments list, the Chocolate Hills of Bohol are a geomorphic wonder and truly a sight to behold. It is one of the best places in the Philippines to offer a unique landscape, with its 1,268 cone-shaped hills that turn chocolatey brown during the dry season, hence its name.","We have already seen the chocolate hills while we were on the way to, I guess, the highest peak among all of them. You are gonna climb all the way to the top of it so you could see a 360 degrees of the Chocolate Hills. It was exhausting to climb all the way to the top and my 65 year old mom wasn't even able to make it to the top.

Hanging Coffins,Sagada,Echo Valley,Mountain Province,N/A,N/A,300,"It is a trek to get to the hanging coffins in Sagada, located deep in the northern Cordillera Mountains, but the sight is something most people in the world will never see.

I seriously did not regret a single second of it."
Pagsanjan Falls,Laguna,N/A,Calabarzon,Falls,N/A,270,The only thing more exciting than admiring one of the most notable waterfalls in the Philippines is traversing it in a dugout canoe. The Pagsanjan Falls waterfall is part of the Pagsanjan Gorge National Park.,"We had such a good morning. Stayed at Casa Del Rio and they sorted the boat for us. 1250pp seems expensive but is definitely worth it. The scenery is stunning and we saw plenty of wildlife too, monkeys, kingfishers, and a woodpecker. Easy to do on your own. We got the HM liner bus from Cubao for 166php each.

Hanging Bridge,Tagbilaran,N/A,Bohol,Bridge,N/A,80,"Over the years, the bridge, which was was originally made with woven bamboo, has received some safety reinforcements due to its popularity with tourists. Not to worry though, it still creeks and swings and gives you butterflies in your stomach as you look down at the rushing river below you.","We absolutely loved this site, it was a great source of amusement watching people get their flip flops stuck, and gripping hold of the sides as it wobbled we actually went twice as some other guests at our resort wanted to see it when we told them about it. The story behind the bridge was also very interesting."
Kayangan Lake,Coron,N/A,Palawan,Lake,N/A,300,"Mention the best tourist destinations in the Philippines and Kayangan Lake in Coron, Palawan is surely in the list.

Bayugin Falls,Bulusan,N/A,Sorsogon,Falls,N/A,15,"Visitors in Bulusan flock to the Bulusan Volcano National Park, but not many make it to Bayugin Falls. It's a small waterfall, but the water is very cold and refreshing, especially on a hot and humid day.To get there, drive or take a tricycle up to Bgy. San Francisco. Admission fee is only 15 pesos per guest, vehicle parking costs 20 pesos, and cottages can be rented for 150 pesos.",The waterfall is hard to reach. We had to park at a community center and then walk to the falls. We followed a trail that went way way down to the falls. There are bamboo handrails in some parts but not all the way. One has to be very careful because the path is slippery due to the moss on the ground. Bring some snacks because there are no shops/stores in the area. Reward yourself with a dip in the refreshing and cool waters after walking that far!
Bonbon Beach,Romblon,N/A,Romblon,Beach Resort,N/A,None,"Bonbon Beach in Romblon has fine, white sand, clear waters and a beautiful view. I first learned about Bonbon from another travel blog and decided to visit when I was in the province. Luckily, there weren’t too many people around! Make sure to wait until sunset so you get to see the sky turn into variants of red and orange before getting dark. The beach is easily accessible by public transport from the town. Simply board a tricycle, and tell the driver you'd like to go to Bonbon Beach. There are now flights from Manila to Tablas Island, Romblon, your next gateway to the beach.","Beach by itself is very nice, but old woman, Grace, owner of the guesthouse claimed the beach, trained many aggressive dogs to keep tourists off. She usually let them go to the beach sometimes, so I was bitten by this dogs and had to do antirabies injections. Hope one day this beach will be taken of the dogs and returned to the people of Romblon. Just imagine how it is dangerous for kids, but unfortunately she seems to has informal relationship with barangay secretary and local police, as they refused to accept my report"
