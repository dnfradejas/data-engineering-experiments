Location is walking distance to eateries, convenient stores and bars. 2. Room is big.  3. Full amenities in the room. 4. There’s a decent gym and a pool.  Cons: 1. Wifi is almost non existence. If you depends on wifi for whatever reasons, you might be better off using your own data roaming.  2. The drainage system of the bathtub needs urgent repair. I’ve to step on the lever for the water to drain if not, it’ll take forever.   Please upgrade your wifi before you offered your guest free wifi.",Andy S,"Had a 1 night stop over here February 10th before flying back to the UK, stayed here several times before and always been very impressed.

The WiFi worked fine in the lobby though when I went down for a meal and drinks. Since I visit Philippines regularly I now have a Smart sim in my phone so I was still able to use it in the room, just annoying that I could not use the laptop.

The previous time I stayed in a hotel near the airport but had trouble sleeping due to traffic noise so this time decided to go back to the Berjaya in Makati that I'm familiar with from previous stays. It's only a 15 minute taxi ride from the aiport (if the traffic is kind) costing a little over P200 in the yellow metered airport taxis.  I first stayed here around 10 years ago when it was previously branded as a Best Western Hotel as that was a brand I trusted which you could rely on for a certain standard of service.

When I walked in, had to wait, and when it was my turn, was told P999 rooms are fully booked but there are other rooms at full rate. WTF! Bait and Switch! Desperate, I accepted.  The room I was given only has 1 pair of slippers. The aircon was not cooling the room so I had to call Room Service. 2 guys went up and checked the window-type aircon...it got frost, so was told to turn it off for 10 minutes. I asked for a room transfer as this is not acceptable.  No rooms available. So I had to sleep thru a warm aircon.

Foul smell. -Limited choices for breakfast buffet and the taste of the food is not that great. -Hallway and elevator smells bad (cigarettes). I suggest that they set-up diffuser in each floor to lessen the bad smell. - You have to leave the keycard in order for them to clean the room.

The location was really nice, near to malls, restos and convenient stores. We stayed in the family room at the 12th floor and elevator only services up to the 10th floor. Another elevator was under maintenance. No other option but to use the stairs from the 10th carrying my 2 yr old, it was really uncomfortable because you can feel the heat there.

In this part of town, Makati, it's an exceptionally good price for the location alone, and it's not near the red light district like some of the other cheap options. The question is whether you are willing to rough it. This room was dreadful. The bedside table was missing its top. There was a used condom under it, and a used toothbrush in the bathroom.The bed was the sort that makes you feel itchy just looking at it. In short, it's not been well kept or cleaned.

It is a 14 days rule to stay in a quarantine facility, you have to stay and wait for the results, that you are negative in Covid for swab test, and rapid test.   You are not allowed to go out, so make sure that there will be someone who can deliver your food at the hotel. Hotels are all quarantine facility this time  At first, I was expecting they will give me a large room, but since I don't need one, they prefer this giving it to me, a single solo room.  Before you sleep in your beds, make sure all the linens, pillow case, bed sheets must be pull out to make sure that you are sleeping with no stains,",melanievzhu,"Had an overnight stay. Didn’t expect my room was that nice because of the low rate I paid. I was assisted by Princess Macarilay from the front desk, she’s very kind and pleasing. But the security guards are kind of rude and not welcoming. Idk why. All in all, it was a nice stay. They didn’t have an electric kettle in the room though also the aircon was not that cold also the water from the shower room was leaking through the sliding glass door. My room got flooded.",Troi T,"I stay here in this hotel just last week. The hotel room were clean and my requests were given immediately.. Thanks to Mr. Christian, the room attendant.  But during our check in I saw a small lady who watching us and I thought she was watching us but when I look at her, she was looking at the girl in the front desk. I just feel that the staff feel nervous that time. Hoping she was okay as she was respectful to us",MR. CD,The hotel  and room is cleaned and the staff are nice lalong lalo na si sir Apollo Tan his always approachable.the reception is very accomodating entertaining my question.. I highly recommend this hotel well done guys😀😀..,Ed C,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data

 Makati,Tourist Site,Ayala Triangle Gardens,A patch of green and inspired public art in the center of the business district. Free wifi throughout the parkRead more,Gardens,"Paseo De Roxas St Cor Makati Ave Cor Ayala Ave, Makati, 1209 Metro Manila",0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,I was on my way to Lepanto Bldg just accross Ayala Triangle when my car bogged down. Three tire bolts  got lost on right front wheel.So I parked on the entrance.Luckily traffic enforcers of both Ayala center and the city government went to the rescue.A  certain Villanueva helped me solved the problem together with a colleague. He said they are part of a rescue team for motorists.It was around 11 p.m. no other cars due to the curfew.There are food stalls at day time here.The Aquino monument is a walking distance from the garden. During Christmas time the trees are filled with sparkling led lights for an evening light and sound show every holiday season. This year the show might be cancelled. So all you get here is fresh air in the morning or evening.,Jun Ruaya,"Passed through this small park a few times whilst staying in Makati on a weekend trip in Feb. It's nice enough park, albeit fairly small. Probably not worth making a special visit to see, but you may want to pass through and have a look if already in the vicinity.",KGB777,Ayala triangle is one of the nice place in makati.there are many trees and a nice place to relax..very clean.,Jy Go,"Always feels good jogging or walking around Ayala Triangle, especially in the mornings or in-between draining meetings at work.",Par G.,Went here on the 24th of December to see and witness the Lights and sound show . The place is crowded as most are waiting for the show. i love the open air show and the ceiling show. amazing. The park is great with some food restaurant to choose from. Its for sure great to visit in this park in a regular day that it will not be crowded and would love to do that like picnic style or just relaxing one afternoon.,Ron,"Ayala Triangle Gardens is a very scenic 2-hectare triangular park located in the Makati Central Business District.  It is owned by Ayala Land, a major land and building developer in the Philippines.  This park is in the immediate vicinity of two major hotels, The Peninsula and the Makati Shangri-La.  The park is a very pleasant place for walking, jogging and sight-seeing.  Ayala is building a huge new beautiful complex of residential and commercial space buildings at the edge of the park and when this is completed it will add to the appeal of the park.A very relaxed and beautifully landscaped area that is well worth a visit.A line of restaurants that used to be opened have mostly closed as part of the park renovation.",Aruba1204,"My go-to area for my afternoon walks.  This is in the middle of the central business district and its park-like but with all the cars passing through the area after office there is pollution catches by the lush green trees.This is also where Christmas lights and sound show is held every December.  A must-see when in the area this time of the yearCoffee shops, restaurants are lined up and busy during lunch/dinner.  They don’t close after lunch so arrive around 5ish and you’ll get a table.",Yvet D,The Ayala Triangle garden is not what it is used to be - greenery gardens.  The triangle is undergoing a commercial transformation where large buildings are being constructed. It is not place to enjoy the gardens.,Edu L,The place is good hangout place specially at night. The view is also nice for photographers but the guards are really strict (they do not allow tripods). There are nice restaurants/coffee shop in the area.,ztpg,the quick tiny ants that try to get into your personal space and stuff.  There was also security around so I felt safe with my backpack. ,travelerR,"How wonderful that the park remains untouched despite of all the skyscrapers being built along the Ayala Business District. It is nice to have a park a few blocks away from the office where one can eat, relax, sit back and enjoy the nature. The light show during Christmas is excellent. But in some ways, it does feel like an intrusion to an otherwise idyllic place on a normal evening. Still, why not in the spirit of the holidays?!",Guicell H,"Situated right smack at the centre of Makati, amidst the Stock Exchange Building and others, it has a line of restaurants along one side and the rest are greeneries. Too bad there’s some construction on one side now and it bothers me that one of the many interesting city lungs are being reduced in size. Check out their light show at night from Christmas onwards. The whole place is beautifully lit up. Mesmerising. ",Rax Yabut,Nice location since its far from the main road and you will enjoy the christmas lights show there...,Chanwengcheong,i like the cleanliness of the place very convenience to the mall and its near to the heart of the city,Madelaine A,A section of grass and trees in middle of Makati .   Eating places on the side .  Toilets Pleasant for a relaxing recovery from the noise and chaos of Manila. No parking. ,travelmate,"The places to eat are good, beautiful park to visit in the middle of a very chaotic city, to chill with friends and family. The light show at Christmas is totally beautiful.",Neil M,"Amazing free light show set to Christmas music.  Very nice to sit and relax, watching the show.  Highly recommend",Santiagowhite,"This is a good place to just chill , read something , relax . For athletic ones , stroll , jogging or brisk walking would do. Many restaurants line the place, either for meals , desserts or just coffee. Come evening , it’s time for that light and sound show. Specific for children and those on a date. Didn’t wait that long though , for it is quite humid during that time.",Joel,Great place to go for a stroll after the daily grind! It offers a good number of restaurants to choose from if you are looking for a place to dine in as well.,doctorfoxtrot,This used to be a nice park situated in the hustle and bustle of Makati CBD. It was bigger then but the local government allowed a high rise luxurious apartment tower to be built. Imagine a public space with a soon-to-be-open apartment skyscraper. Really sad..,Nyonyi

You will fond mostly the essentials and some branded products.  I like to hang around here for restaurant dining, just because we are staying in a hotel walking distance from here.  Overall, a neat mall and less messy. ",grace virlouvet,"Restaurant and coffee shops are everywhere, bridges and a tunnel link you to other stores across the streets, green belt 3 great place to mingle with the locals while enjoying a fresh cup of coffee , only slight negative lots of construction esp around green belt 3 but over all great place buy and just walking around and meeting the Philippine people",Garland V,"This is a high end mall, not that different from similar establishments you find anywhere else in the world. All the usual generic high end brands. No real reason to go here unless that's your thing. Also a bunch of restaurants to choose from, again nothing too exciting.",KGB777,"Such a maze of shops and restaurants. Lovely to wander day or night and teaming with people at all hours. Great range for all budgets and spacious enough to cope with peak hour crowds. Good atmosphere. Can get a little overwhelming due to the size and  easy to get lost, but there are enough signs for you to get buy. Plus, there is always security around that can help point you in the right direction.",Mel LM,Great shopping options for everyone and a lot of restaurants with much different food. Easy to walk around with the kids and wheelchair. ,Espen V,A fun place easy to enjoy easy to relax people are very helpful very honest very genuine always want to see you happy good happy place to be,Hammer13,Greenbelt mall is soo big.there are so many restaurants there even though its a little bit expensive but its really yummy!!😍😍.the place is very clean.no wonder why mostly foreigners choose to stay there.five stars👍😍,Jy Go,"Nothing special, security very tight to get in, very friendly, just your standard shopping mall, food hall very good and cheap but prices no different to back home in Australia ",eenski,"This place is massive, so much to see and buy. We spent around 4 hours going to each area, beware if you are a smoker there isn't many smoking areas. Staff and security guys were so friendly and helpful when we couldn't find our way out. ",Alan M,"This one of the best malls in Makati City. You could find the best restaurants, cafes and signature shops under one roof. It is accessible by taxi, bus and a connecting patway to the MRT train.",Edu L,"When in Manila, it's a must to stroll around the Greenbelt area, there are many fine shops, restaurants and coffee shops, also almost attached to it you have the shopping complex ""Glorietta"" which is quite big and its full of shops, restaurants and department stores. in Greenbelt you can stroll around it's magnificent park not large but well kept. If you like the nightlife there is a very popular place called ""Havana"" which has nightly entertainment with live bands that feature Latin music, Everytime that I have been there it's been very busy.",Footprints263173,Their movie theaters are normally my family's first choice simply because the seats are comfortable and the theater itself is very nice and clean. There are also a ton of food options to bring in such as Vegan and Meaty options. A ton of restaurants to go eat at after too. Can't really go wrong in choosing greenbelt.,Nello G,"Mall in Ayala that's closer to the Central business district of Makati city.  This is the go-to mall of office peeps from watching movies after work to having coffee or having dinner.  New World Hotel is just across the mall and some condos who's into Airbnb.It has 7cinemas about 180seats each, salons, spa's, catholic chapel, garden, local & international restaurants, concierge/information for inquiries or area locator, BPI bank and if you need other banks it's just in the outskirts of the mall, pharmacies, restaurants.  International brands include Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and the like so you probably have an idea who hangs out in this mall. It's nice to have coffee and chill, I love the vibe here it's more relaxing compared to the fast paced next door mall Glorietta though both are owned by the Ayala's.",MinsMarket,A lot of people going here. Especially artist in the Philippines. I already see a lot of artist in here.,Yvet D,Huge high end mall but also connects to other lower end commodity establishments. Very safe for tourists. Easy to get to.,Casey,nice mall favoritr one more to offrr likr restaurants and good location definitely this is my favorute mall,Elaine F,"Great place for shopping and dining out Lots of choices in fashion , dining and cafes.

There is upscale shopping here with louis vuitton, hermès, gucci, etc...also this is where you will find a bunch of international restaurants as well as local flavors. There are many bars here, and lots of famous people in the Philippines hang out here as well as a lot of expats. We could spend many hours here just shopping eating and people watching. When in manila looking for something to do definitely stop by greenbelt.",Waleed AlWafi,"Gosh this place was overwhelming at times but it was cool to walk around and explore. Our favourite thing we did was go to the escape rooms on Greenbelt mall 1. It only cost 300 pesos per person and the boys there were lovely. Would recommend walking around, lots of great places to eat at ",International_Traveler,Greenbelt is a nice a place to to shop and eat.  There are many stores and restaurants.
