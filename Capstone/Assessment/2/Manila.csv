Fort Santiago, the main fortress of Intramuros established by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi on the site of the former wooden fort of Rajah Soliman in 1572, was burned during the siege of the Chinese Pirate Lin Fen (Limahong) in 1574. It was reconstructed with local tuff (adobe) from 1590 - 1593. It was the citadel of the armies of four foreign powers: Spain üá™üá∏ from 1571 to 1898; Great Britain üá¨üáß  from 1762 through 1764 during the Seven Year War; United States üá∫üá∏ from 1898 to 1946; and the Empire of Japan üáØüáµ from 1942 through 1945 during the Second World War. It was declared a National Shrine and a National Monument in 1951 and as a National Cultural Treasure in 2014.     The marker, Last Walk to Martyrdom Trail, a centennial freedom trail characterized by the shoe prints of Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal, memorializes the path he took to Bagumbayan from his cell in Fort Santiago in the early hours of December 30, 1896. It symbolizes the birth of the Filipino nation. The marker was unveiled on December 27, 1996 during the incumbency of His Excellency President Fidel V. Ramos.      Another point of interest for me was the Postigo de la Nuestra Se√±ora de Soledad, a postern used as access from Fort Santiago to the Pasig River, from whence Lieutenant General Simon de Anda, leader of the Spanish Resistance against the British Occupation of Manila from 1762 through 1768 during the Seven Year War after a siege of Intramuros by the British Army.      A white stone cross marks the final resting place of approximately 600 Filipinos and Americans who were victims of atrocities including starvation and possibly suffocation by the Japanese Imperial Forces, during the last days of February 1945, who were found inside a nearby dungeon which had inner doors of massive iron bars and outer doors of iron plates on wood.",Pat r,"Visiting Fort Santiago is going through the different phases of Philippine history. The Spanish architecture of the buildings reminds us of Spain‚Äôs colonial rule, which heavily influenced the Philippine culture and psyche, making the country a unique country in Asia for having a lot of things in common with the Latin world and Europe. The prison cell and museum for Jose Rizal provided an educational tour about his life. His trial room, and the depiction of his footsteps from his prison cell going to where he would be executed enriched my understanding about his life. The museum about Intramuros, Manila‚Äôs walled city had the miniature models of the grand, gorgeous buildings which Manila had, before the bombings during World War II destroyed them all and they were never rebuilt. Much of Manila was destroyed during the war, but most of the colonial buildings were never rebuilt.

We were in the city for 24h and hotel staff recommended to visit, so we got a hotel-taxi (45mins from BCG to Intramuros, may take longer depending on traffic) and had an enjoyable afternoon. Intramuros is the old town and the building style is very much European. You can easily walk around the streets, there is little traffic, mostly bike-taxis that offer to take you on a guided tour. Since we needed some exercise we walked around the old fort and city walls (rather wear closed shoes than flip-flops, little bit dirty and there may be a rainpour). We started our walking tour at Fort Santiago and walked down to Rizal Park and back, visiting the Basilika Menore (a cathedral that had been destroyed 7 times through war or earthquakes and rebuild 8 times) and walked along the city walls. The streets are full of business, students and merchants, curio shops, street food and large governmental offices. We felt safe spending time there. Some of the bike-guides were a bit nagging but a friendly repeat-'No, thank you' did the job. Unfortunately we had no time to visit any of the museums but there is so much history to explore here (colonialism, WWII, post war era, ...). We spent 2.5h in Intramuros and it gave us a good impression of another part of this city, one that is not spick-and-span and glitzy with flashing lights but rather one that is full of friendly faces, local food and a lot of history. ",Jennifer Mendoza,"The old part of Manila and worth seeing, particularly the fort. The golf course around the outside of the walls looked amazing although we didn‚Äôt have time to play. ",inhale-exhale321,"If youbgave a day or less in Manila and don‚Äôt know what to do- the least you can see is this. The buildings are not that impressive but it still nice- the history is very interesting. I especially liked how lively everything was- these are not ruins that only tourists visit, but a fun and vibrant part of the city where locals live, work and relax.",Bernadine S,I shared a wonderful afternoon with friends going a deep appreciation of the local history.

On the downside it is a very disorganized place and it is not the cleanest place I have ever visited. The staff were all very friendly. The price for admittance was reasonable. I was continually unaware how to get to the next exhibit. However there were many very great exhibits and the live show was well worth visiting Ocean Park if you get to Manila.

One exception are retablos on Seven session of the cross from a church on the island of Bohol which still has some great colonial churches.

Lot of explanation about the different cultures in Philippines. A must if you are planning to visit more traditional areas of the country.The fine art wing has great room, but you have to select because it seems they have put everything they have on the wall. Very nice painting of old colonial Christian art and nice local painters. The most part of the collection we have seen is from 20th Century.",Indy27,This was one of the absolute finest museums I have ever visited in the world.  I would recommend a whole day (they‚Äôre open 7 hours per day) to see the entire museum.  Anything less would not do justice for all they display here.  A serious art connoisseur could easily spend two full days.  The building is massive with 3 floors.  The emphasis is on Philippine art and history.  Be sure to factor in the Manila traffic when going to the museum.  It took almost an hour to get to the museum from Makati with Grab (only a 5 mile drive!).  So if you want to start your day when they open at 10 AM I‚Äôd recommend leaving your hotel or home at around 9 AM (depending on your location possibly earlier).

Still, it will be worth your while. The architectural design is nice and you definitely will find a lot of amazing things related to nature.

Every floor offers a different aspect of fauna and flora. Exhibits have very good signage and range from mangroves to freshwater, wetlands and volcanoes. You can easily spend tow to three hours here, so you might as well combine this with a visit to the Museum of Anthropology.

Highly recommended.",Paul V,"The museum was free of charge, and is close other museums in the area, so you can also visit other museums as well. The other government-funded museums were also free of charge. The museum is a repository of species that can be found in the Philippines, but there are plenty of them. In every floor and section of the museum, you‚Äôll find different kinds of ecosystems where those species thrive. There was also a life-size model of Lolong, probably the world‚Äôs largest saltwater crocodile that has ever lived or captured. There were few people when I visited and the building was spacious and had a cozy atmosphere. If you‚Äôre interested about species in the Philippines, it‚Äôs a great place to visit.  Some people mixes up this museum with the other museums. This museum is for appreciation of the different species and ecosystems in the Philippines.

Recommended.",Paul V,"This mall is centrally located in Ermita, Manila.It‚Äôs busy, chaotic and full of exciting things to do.  Lots of eating places in all price range, shopping galore!",20Twenty,"Whatever you need and want, you can find it there. The place is big and there‚Äôs a wide varieties of shops, even a cinema. Only bad thing is, the toilets are far apart. ",Andy S,"If you want to experience real Manila come here. It is packed with local shoppers, great restaurants and various stores with great and funny names.",TravelAdventureGurus,A big ass mall near a hospital. It is said it is the first robinson mall in the Philippine. There are also pimps outside the mall at night.,Nico Samneil Sy Salado,"Great mall, that has everything. Whatever you want to buy you can find it there. The food court is great, but there are other food shops also scattered all over the mall. Security is the usual for this type of mall, which doesn't bother me at all. On my 2 weeks stay in Luzon, visited the mall about 5 times.",Michael N,"Meeting and diners are superb. Maximum style finds. Price varies. Food choice is amazing. Shop and dine safety in Manila's jewel leisure place. Wine and booze too. Movies. Barber. Nails. What have u, they serve best.",Stay44813782149,This is a good mall to see. It has many restaurants. You can take a rest here while you try and explore manilaüëç,ray m,Nice small clean lots of western stores and of course many other local ones. You can buy anything you want neither,falwelldan,"Just where all the thousands who visit this excellent shopping centre come from is a mystery but shop and dine they do.The mall keeps reinventing itself.I had a mid meal superb snack at a newish small restaurant, Pound, and easily found an item I needed at Robinsons Department Store.But apart from a haircut, most of my attention was on the extremely popular Robinsons Supermarket where I had a 13 minute wait to be served. Probably because of worries about theft, Filipino supermarkets have not introduced self service checkouts. The cashier was very slow and did not have a male packer to assist her.  However the supermarket has a very good range.  Try to shop here at 1000 in the morning ehen there are no queues.Security guards all speak English and immediately can inform shoppers where individual stores are, but there is also computerised display board information.The MRT elevated railway Line 1 is an easy walk along Pedro Gil Street.",Craig R,Me and my husband goes here whenever we are in Manila because it is the closest in our office. This mall is complete from out favorite restaurant to my favorite massage parlor and shopping. ,Victorianlad,"The reason i am giving Robinsons Mall such a high rating over SM is because of its customer service. As a Canadian, the customer service was so much better than SM.More importantly, you can use your 11 pin foreign bank card password at Robinsons or any other restaurants and Bank of Manila card machine but you cant use it at SM and BDO card machines. SM kept on asking me for my bank cards but Canadians always use 11 pin password for privacy concerns. Robinsons is okay with 11 pins but SM is not. So SM sucks and Robinsons is the best. ",HHS,"Robinson Mall has been here for years. It has grown and expanded. It is easy to get lost in and come out a different entrance than where you came in. I use my GPS to get around. There are money changers, cellphone stores, food courts, full service restaurants, little shops and large international brand shops like Marks and Spencer and Body Shop. Parking underneath, movie theaters and a full service spa and Massage as well s a gym. But the prices are reasonable here not like some other malls in Manila. Safe and security at all entrances ",HaveFoodyWillTravel,"This is one of the most confusing malls I have ever see - easy to get lost but in a good way.  Everything from designer shops to M&S and market stallsSome of the hawkers can be a bit annoying, buy they do have a job to do.",Roger C,"My go to place whenever I wanna eat out and shop. Lots of varieties when it comes to restaurants and shops. The only problem I have is that the department store layout is confusing. Location is good, it's near the pedro gil lrt station and accessible by jeepney. ",DumbApe,"We  often  go  to  Robinsons Mall very  convenient everything in  one  Mall Great  Restaurants, Shopping venues Movie  Theaters Grocery Stores.  During our vacation November 8through December 5 2019 We  enjoy  hanging out  @ Robinsons Mall",pola

No wonder it's the choice for many to get married there.  It felt solemn enough and yet you also feel the vibrancy emanating from the church.,luxetrip,Amazing beautiful place to see You will be amazed and astounded by the beautiful architecture and the stained-glass windows this place is a must see,Hammer13,"Beautiful old church in Intramuros area of Manila, near restaurants and shops. Well maintained, with centuries of history. Definitely see it.",ms57-ny,"One of the most beautiful churches i have been. My friend's wedding was also held here last August 2019. Despite the heavy rain during the wedding ceremony, surroundings are safe and secured especially the parked cars outside the vicinity. Has a nice lobby for guest and a little reception area. The only thing that I can suggest to further improve accessibility and convenience is to put additional cemented flooring on parkings because of the mud and dirt from heavy rains. Nonetheless, experience was astounding.Will definitely get a booking for our wedding this 2022.",Abner V. Pineda,Must visit once . It's one of the nicer things to experience Manila. Of course there are other attractions too. Manila sure does has a lot to offer. ,Farid K,"Rich and amazing history captured in this shrine, came away with many insights into the impact the church had on the development of the country.",AustinSmoothie,"This is the oldest church of Manila within the walls of Intramuros. If you are lucky, you can see some marriages inside.",Christopher W,This church that dates back to the 1500s is quite amazing and I think the oldest church in the Philippines.I was awestruck by the painted surfaces (walls and curved ceiling panels) that you'd swear were carved stone.The history is fascinating... read the plaques... the story of the huge bell... and marvel at the resilience of this amazing piece of Filipino history. üåº,DaisyQ3,Definitely well worth a visit to this church without a doubt as it has such great history and many icons inside that any guide will be able to explain to you further should you wish to ask. Recommended - Enjoy.,badmintontim,"This old Church is a part of Manila history, inside you find the museum wich is huge, you need at least 3 hours to go in every room and to study the objects, a must see",Relax03976272131,A beautiful church inside the fort.  The building looks huge from outsidr but smaller inside.  It looks lije ghe brompton oratory church in knightbrige albeit smaller scale,Catalin N,"A historic and beautiful church tucked away in the walled part of Manila. The streets around are narrow and made of stones, reminiscent of Europe. I enjoyed the architecture and tranquilness.",Teo D,"San Agustin is the sole survivor of the Battle of Manila at the end of WWII, during which the rest of Intramuros was leveled. It's a beautiful old church that is constantly being restored. There is a lot to see here, so plan for a few hours. It's more than just a church, there's a cloister, and a museum, and you can pretty much go all over the place. I spent the better part of a morning here. It always feels good to be transported back in time.",homegrownhero,To be a world heritage site I expected a really great looking church. It was ok but not as impressive looking as many I've seen in Philippines.  There was a wedding on so I could not to inside unfortunately.,bklynbubba,"I‚Äôve been to many cathedrals worldwide and San Agustin is perhaps the most majestic and beautiful of them all. The church grounds also has a museum that features many impressive pieces of historical spiritual art.  The best way to visit the church is to buy a ticket to the museum and see both the church and museum on your visit.  Trust me, you will not want to visit just one.  You‚Äôll need at least a few hours to see both.  I had absolute complete freedom to roam anywhere on the property including up to the magnificent organ room on the upper level of the church. This was probably my favorite site during my Manila trip even though I‚Äôm not religious. You‚Äôll find endless beautiful historical religious artifacts and works of art throughout the church and museum.  Please remember this is still an active running church so please observe silence when visiting, especially in the church itself.",G2Kpauly,Beautiful architecture inside and out. The church stood witness both Spanish and American incursions. The Altar is a true work of art with delicate details as well as the apse and the columns. The church is postcard perfect from the courtyard to the Altar.,Steven T,The church is situated in a very spacious area. Free from noise outside as it is having a distance from the very busy street.,efrenr916,"It can be another destination inside Intramuros, the walled city of Manila. The Church is of Gothic architecture, reminiscent of the Spanish colonial days. The chandeliers are so commanding- best to visit during early evening mass so the lights are turned on. You can visit the museum right beside the church while waiting for the holy mass to start. The museum showcases the images and sculptures that best show how deep Catholicism is embedded in Philippine culture, values and ideology",tolentinomaldex,An ok site to visit but nothing great. Art work and statures were just ok. Nothing over the top here but if it's raining may be something to do.,Red-Stilleto

What a great find!  Completely immersive with lots of statues and other artifacts to admire.,luxetrip,"For this landmark is best to allocate half a day in order to go through entire building and several expositions that are arranged in.There is that nice feeling of history (although can't be compared with what we used to see in Europe or India or China), many informative posters with facts of how the place appeared etc.",Angel Milev,This place is a must to see all the relics that are being displayed here. Entrance is free and there's more than 1 floor to visit.,Christopher W,This is attached to the church and if you have time then should combine visiting here with a visit to the church as well,badmintontim,"You could be in medieval Spain, or wandering through a cloister in South America, but you are not. you are in the Philippines. And once you see that replica of a Manila Galleon, the pieces will all start to fall into place. ",bklynbubba,The San Agustin Museum is attached to the magnificent and historical San Agustin church.  You should visit both the church and the museum on the same visit.  The museum is spread over the entire massive grounds over two floors.  Many of the pieces tell the story of the evolution Christianity in the Philippines.  You could easily spend at least a couple of hours in just the museum itself.  I spent a few hours on the entire property including the church.  There are two beautiful gardens on the property.  Be sure and look for the turtles in the inner garden fountain.  Don‚Äôt get too close to the fountain because they‚Äôll swim underwater.  They appear to be shy and very aware of people.  ,Steven T,"The museum was a wealth of history that traced back to the Spanish landing in Philippines.  It was unfortunate that it was heavily damaged during WWII and many of the treasures were destroyed but the church and grounds were rebuilt.  What relics and important artifacts that were saved, salvaged or returned to the church were displayed in a number of different temperature controlled rooms.  A lot were lost.  Paintings of saints and retablos (altars) lined the walkways with windows that over looked the courtyard.The central garden courtyard was green and popular for group photos while the gardens in the back,  accessed through the gift shop, was more secluded and nice for a contemplative walk.The crypt was unique with no matching niches.  The famous painter, Juan Luna, was interred here.I recommend going to the second floor where the choir sits near the organ.  From that vantage point one could look down onto the main church floor and the altar.  The ornate ceiling was actually like a painting.  View was available even when the church was closed for a wedding.  ",wireless_in_CA,Please go as did 2 popes and see the rebuilt church as its highly valued and has a grace and importance for Manila and the Philippines that no other church can represent,Lawland L,"To those who've been here before, it's worth coming back.  Being that it's now a UNESCO site, the place has been really cleaned up, some rooms now have airconditioning (!) and the artifacts inside are such a part of North Luzon history.",faye jhoy,A good place to explore agustin monk's heritage and the history of missionaries in Asia  (though somewhat biased in that regard.) ,Michael_dlr,This was a great experience being able to visit both the old San Agustin Cathedral AND the very well laid-out Museum inside. It was a beautifully hot day but the courtyards were cool and permeated by refreshing breezes.,Patri2002,The Museum is located in the Intramuros area and is free and open to the public. There are many statues of religious artifacts. You can also see the underground water system.,Perry B,"The museum is loaded with relics of the founding of the first church in Manila.  Due to frequent disaster and war time marauders a lot is no longer here, but what is here is stunning. ",Arnold C,"Stopped here on a whim and we are glad we did.  Very big museum that went into great detail about St. Augustine, the monks, and the impact on the Philippines.  We have visited museums like this in Europe, but this was less crowded and more informative.  English was used throughout the museum.",Daniel D,"If you're into seeing religious relics, then this museum within the church complex is for you. The entrance fee is a bit higher compared to other attractions within Intramuros. The whole complex is air-conditioned, so it's a good opportunity to cool down after venturing on a sight-seeing tour in the area. It features antic collections of religious items, but the highlight for me is the view of the altar from the balcony. ",tosl,"Went here to have an appreciation of every memorabilia available during the Spanish era. The collection was vast and very interesting. I had a feel of how it was during that time. Indeed, worth the visit! When you go to Intramuros Manila, you may want to include it in your bucket list!",Thundercat76,"Nice seeing a historic place being handled so well, I hope they can preserve this place for the next generation",mickey,I could've spent all day here. A lot to view in this beautiful example of Spanish/Christian architecture. ,Ulysses
