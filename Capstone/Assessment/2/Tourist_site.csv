They are very beautiful and self-explain about the history of the country.,Hellen Mai,"Upon entering, the first major painting was the Spolarium by Jose Luna. It was entered and won the top prize in Spain in the 1800s and eventually was returned as a gift from the Spanish government to the Philippines. The painted scene showed what happened after a gladiator fight but we were told the figures represented the Filipino suffering under Spanish rule. It was a powerful painting on a grand scale.We enjoyed visiting this museum and learning more about the National Artists that contributed much to the Filipino cultural heritage. I highly recommend coming back multiple times and enjoying the art work.",audreyb120,"Structure is ok but contentwise, nothing much. I hope they add more items. It can get chaotic and noisy when students visit.",Citygal12456,"This is one of the 4 part of National Museum in ManilaI did 2 Visit to to museum one is and the other one is natural history.In this Museum, i loved the art displayed the carvings, the paintings, the old artifacts, the history and story of every displays.I can say 2 to 3 hours roaming around this bldg will give you lots of information and knowledge about Philippines.Very informative.The building is quite old but i like.Worth the visit.No Entrance Fee.8 am to 4 pm admission if am not mistaken.",Ron,I was in Manila for my first time and had heard this was a place to visit. It was awesome. Many paintings and art from the Philippine history. Many staff to help you understand the history. I was told I couldn't wear my hat inside and no flash pictures. The are was very historical and the Catholic Church was a large part of the art. There were many students touring the museum at the same time.I sat down many times to observe the art. A lot of art focusing on Jose Rizal who is thought of as the founder of the current Philippines. It was very interesting to me a a history buff. I had a very enjoyable time except I lost my ball cap in the museum since I couldn't wear it. Salamat to the staff and also to all those who loaned or gave the art to the museum.,Sarge57,"There are 3 Museums Art, Natural and Anthropology which are completely free admission and you will see tons of stuff, If you like museums this is a must visit when you are in the Philippines. The tour will take your whole day. ",elxar,Amazing place to know how important the value of your country is. It has amazing themes on every floors with wide arrays of collections from different natural environment to different flora and fauna found in the Philippines. Just hopefully there'd be available more in house security to make sure that these precious collections are well taken care of especially alot of teens can easily touch the displays.,angelicious0327,"Philippines were the most remote outpost of Spanish Empire  and the first thing one notices after visiting this museums after those in Mexico, Peru or Ecuador is the absence of great colonial at form 16th, 17th and 18th century. This may also be due to the fact that Manila was so heavily destroyed, including most colonial buildings in intramuros during the Japanese occupation and American bombing. One exception are retablos on Seven session of the cross from a church on the island of Bohol which still has some great colonial churches. There is also a great deal of information on the liberation of the city from Japanese occupation and some halls displaying paintings of leading 19th century paintings as well as Rizal: his portraits by other painters and his own artistic work.",Las Buganvillas,"If you are into art this would be for you. But if you are into culture and history, skip this and go to National Museum of Antropology which is in between rizal park and this.",Hmcc85,"Very interesting museum, with a diverse collection of paintings and sculptures. This was a great suggestion for a local visit",Margarida V,"Museum exhibit is great! Admission is free, you just need to write your name down in the ""book"". Go in early to avoid the field trip groups. Customer service in the bag drop off/claim section is lacking. The lady there descriminates against ""local"" looking Filipinos (I have brown skin and unaltered nose) and the ""mestiza"" lady who clearly had a bag much larger than mine, and she was given admittance; along with the foreigner with his full hiking backpack. Too bad that mentality is still around. Cut short my visit to that museum.",Joy T,"This edifice is home of the country national treasure for fine arts. The works of Luna, Hidalgo and Amorsolo an etc. Are among the notable art works. Have a minimum of two hours for this visit and you will surely enjoy the place ",Elaine F,You can spend hours here and the exhibits are first rate. The history of the Philippines is wonderfully displayed in a massive museum that is a must to see. Located in a pleasant park area you will be amazed at the historical and cultural displays located in the museum. Truly a gem of a place.,Siegfred A,"The National Museum is a big complex of different wings.We have visited « Fine art » and «Ethnology ».First: it’s free! We were really surprised!And there a lot of young curious Philippino. We had a preference to the ethnological collection. The traditional costume and textiles were wonderful. Lot of explanation about the different cultures in Philippines. A must if you are planning to visit more traditional areas of the country.The fine art wing has great room, but you have to select because it seems they have put everything they have on the wall. Very nice painting of old colonial Christian art and nice local painters. The most part of the collection we have seen is from 20th Century.",Indy27,This was one of the absolute finest museums I have ever visited in the world.  I would recommend a whole day (they’re open 7 hours per day) to see the entire museum.  Anything less would not do justice for all they display here.  A serious art connoisseur could easily spend two full days.  The building is massive with 3 floors.  The emphasis is on Philippine art and history.  Be sure to factor in the Manila traffic when going to the museum.  It took almost an hour to get to the museum from Makati with Grab (only a 5 mile drive!).  So if you want to start your day when they open at 10 AM I’d recommend leaving your hotel or home at around 9 AM (depending on your location possibly earlier).  If you only have time to visit one museum in Manila this one would be it hands down.  ,Panamalor,One of the underrated repositories of art in Asia this place packs historicism and artistry. Housed in a grand heritage colonial legislative building that was severely damaged in the WW2 bombings are the grand collections put together by various private business entities that provides a narrative of the artistic heritage of the country. From European impressionist influences to the rise of nationalism and modernism and some stunning religious pieces. Worth a three hour visit.,Steven T,Allot one whole day for you and your family to be able to explore the 3 buildings of National Museum plus the National Planetarium.Half day is not enough especially of you will visit after lunch.Best to visit early in the morning.,Choo-Beng G,"The PI is not a rich nation and lacks the depth of many American and European museums. The National museum however is a nice place to visit. Very clean and wll kept. Many local artist are exibited here. Definitelty worth the time but do not expect to see Renoirs, Monets and Dali's here. That ebing said I am glad we stopped by and highly recommend it for a slice of the local artists and hostory well displayed in a air con building with clean restrooms.",Jennifer G,"This museum is located in the heart of the country's capital. It houses an impressive collection of paintings and other art, as well as various artifacts that show Filipino life before the colonizers. It might not be that popular, but it is a must-visit place in the Philippines. It has also been recently renovated and offers free entrance every now and then.

All the usual generic high end brands. No real reason to go here unless that's your thing. Also a bunch of restaurants to choose from, again nothing too exciting.",KGB777,"Such a maze of shops and restaurants. Lovely to wander day or night and teaming with people at all hours. Great range for all budgets and spacious enough to cope with peak hour crowds. Good atmosphere.

We spent around 4 hours going to each area, beware if you are a smoker there isn't many smoking areas. Staff and security guys were so friendly and helpful when we couldn't find our way out.

There are also a ton of food options to bring in such as Vegan and Meaty options. A ton of restaurants to go eat at after too. Can't really go wrong in choosing greenbelt.,Nello G,"Mall in Ayala that's closer to the Central business district of Makati city.  This is the go-to mall of office peeps from watching movies after work to having coffee or having dinner.  New World Hotel is just across the mall and some condos who's into Airbnb.It has 7cinemas about 180seats each, salons, spa's, catholic chapel, garden, local & international restaurants, concierge/information for inquiries or area locator, BPI bank and if you need other banks it's just in the outskirts of the mall, pharmacies, restaurants.  International brands include Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and the like so you probably have an idea who hangs out in this mall. It's nice to have coffee and chill, I love the vibe here it's more relaxing compared to the fast paced next door mall Glorietta though both are owned by the Ayala's.",MinsMarket,A lot of people going here.

2,Art in Island,Art Museums,No Data,500,"175 15th Ave. Cubao, Quezon City, Luzon 1109 Philippines",it's a one-of-a-kind  showcase of art. The 3-dimensional paintings give one a feeling of being one with it.  It allows you  to interact with it and enjoy the  exciting experience. One should know how to do it.  It is also an experience of knowing the special landmarks of other countries.  It's an expereince how to be a child again. :-),Jane V,Explore your creativity on all the pictures you can capture with their backgrounds and enjoy all the amazing things you can do inside the vicinity,milo_dapilos,"This was the second time I've gone to art in island, but this time with my nephew. Looking at the exhibit, even after 3 years, it is very much the same with some parts showing some wear, but not on a lot of exhibits/paintings.There is a new 'wing' but i'd rather call it a hallway and room. It has a separate ticket price but for the novelty, it was worth the experience just once. But this new area needs a good night mode camera/sensor.Overall, it was an enjoyable experience since my nephew had a lot of fun.But I don't see a reason to come back again as it is more of the same.Even the hourly light show (5 to 10minute projection on walls) hasn't changed from years back.There honestly needs to be something else to bring people back.I fear this place is losing visitors, with the exception on mandatory school tours. I really hope they are able to do some changes to entice people to come back.Price isn't the issue, the novelty has worn out for adults as there isn't anything new to take photos of.",84Cerberus84,"Amazing place, worth the visit! Loads of fun.. Sort of stuck out in nowhere’s land so make sure you take a taxi that knows the area(many who don’t in Manila) ",Jodi J,"A 500-peso bill, a camera (nevermind the quality), an hour, and a photographer (or model) are all it takes to fill your memory disk in an hour.   Because every painting and every angle give different glimpse of a story, and  you don't want your audience to miss any of it.  The alternative challenge is to shift into a pose that gives a unique story --- that is a photo that can sell.Entrance fee won't be worth the while for all personalities. For those people who are merely curious and care about the beauty of the work, spare yourself from the queue. It's not worth the photo. You can visit the museum via the internet. The work here is fantastic, but for those who are not into arts, it's too much to absorb in one visit, and you'll end up less appreciative, yawning and grumpy in the later parts of the tour. For artists, many lessons can be gained here. For people, who enjoys grooming their virtual profiles, this is a paradise for you.",Daring Darling,A must-vist place for people who love to take photos. Kids and kids at heart will surely have fun taking pictures for FB and IG and whatevers. Bought our tickets through an online app.  It's cheaper and you'll spend less time at the booth. ,wena_anew,"If you are an art lover, you’ll love it here as you use your imagination to interact with all the 3D artworks.  My son was up to the challenge on how to creatively pose for the artworks however during our visit there were other schools as well making it difficult to get really nice or decent shots.  Hopefully, when we come back there would be fewer people.  Be here on a weekday to enjoy the experience.The art show about Creation was nice but they gave Adam wings which is kind of misleading because that’s not what the Bible says.  Probably, they should recreate it according to the Biblical truth.",Mharl Cua,"This was my sixth trip to Manila, but I had always put Art in Island in the “too far” basket. What a mistake! This is by far the best attraction in town, regardless of your age or interests. It’s a huge facility with so many installations to look at and photograph. There are also some English captions to guide visitors on the background of the artwork and how to best take a picture. The staff were superb, always on hand to help and advise and it never felt rushed or hectic. It’s 500 pesos to enter, and you need to either go barefoot (as we did) or wear the provided slippers. It’s open from 9:30am till 8:30pm every day except Monday. And if you go, I guarantee you’ll have a new profile picture on some site, somewhere, as well as countless photos to share. Highly recommended!",Saul_True,worth the money. spent the whole 4hrs taking pics. I just wished there were filipino artists involved.,Tina L,"For those who like to pose and take pictures, this is a good place to be. This would be good place to visit when it is raining and when you don’t want to spend time outdoors. This is also a good place to go on a super hot day as it is cool inside. Do make sure to go when there are not many people visiting the place. A call to the museum can easily give you that information.also make sure that you have enough battery on your gadgets.",Rhea E,The place is nice and recommended for kids and group of friends. A walking distance to the big mall in Cubao area.ideal for taking pix .,remalyn m,The theme is unique but there where NO GUIDE to explain or assist the guest while passing the art concept.,dunn,We were taken to Art in Island by a local and I am very pleased we did so.

Fun to do with older kids and teens as they will understand the concept of perspective and will have fun posing  and taking photos. Admission includes a short but very entertaining laser light show at 11:00 am. Make sure you bring along an extra pair of socks as shoes are not allowed inside the museum.,Darren B,"Me, my mom and my kids enjoyed our visit here. We had so much fun taking pictures in the Island Museum. This is highly recommended specially to foreign nationals who visits the Philippines. Kudos Art In Island!!!",JAASM,"Best time to go is when you have already eaten and will not go hungry for another 5 to 6 hours.Wear a good socks (some socks seems slippery) or buy from them (what they sell is a good souvenir socks).If you are a student, bring your ID.Drink lots of water, to be honest, its tiring but its fun.Bring lots and lots of picture perfect poses and a large memory for your camera.Always find the camera spot and a good angle or find a staff to take your photo, since pictures won't look good if you just point and shoot.And also, make sure you appreciate/immerse in the art when coming here.. they are really good paintings.",zheeby2872

We had an excellent private guide and I would suggest that for anyone.,Culture625967,"If you want to have an indepth knowledge of Philippine-Spanish history, this is a must see. This place brings you back in time.  You get this eerie feeling that they're still there.  But that's just me, haha.  Anyway, once outside you will enjoy the different gourmet restaurants serving authentic Filipino food.  And if you're the curious type, there are vendors selling unique products.  If you're in Manila, make sure to set aside some time to visit Fort Santiago.  And if you have more time, you can take a ride in the caritela (horse-drawn coach) and go around the place.  People are very friendly as well.",coyg2019,"I still remember visiting Fort Santiago on one of my previous visits to Manila around 14 years ago, and it remains just as impressive today. Very clean and well maintained, although clearly many of the buildings are in ruins. A fascinating way to experience the colonial era by visiting here.",KGB777,I was thrilled to visit the fort. As a retired US Army military policeman I love to visit military locations from the past. With the history of Fort Santiago it was even better. I loved the fact they keep the walls in place and the historical significance of the fort. Seeing the cannons and the parade field were awesome. So many really cool things. I also enjoyed stopping at one of the businesses at the fort and getting one of the best halo halos (a great dessert) I have ever had.  I would highly recommend this location to be visited if you visit Manila.,Sarge57,"I loved the visit to this fort that is soaked in rich history. I enjoyed the inspirational Rizal shine, dungeons and the media naranja with the view of pasig river. The entrance fee was 75 pesos. The information centre was helpful. You may not find any vegetarian food inside the fort. This is a must-visit in Manila.",Aaqarsh Aiyyar,The Philippines just keeps on giving and giving and giving with amazing places to visit and see amazing cultural places and this is another one of those another must do must see you when you’re in the Philippines,christian c,We hired a tour guide to take us through the fort and walled city.  It is spectacular to see but our guide just made almost all the information up as he went.  A pro liar and a con people like him should be banned.  It’s a pity he ruined our experience!!!! Enjoy on your own though you won’t be disappointed,Hammer13,"Markers document the historical landmarks; it is well lit and safe, with free entertainment at different spots.      Fort Santiago, the main fortress of Intramuros established by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi on the site of the former wooden fort of Rajah Soliman in 1572, was burned during the siege of the Chinese Pirate Lin Fen (Limahong) in 1574. It was reconstructed with local tuff (adobe) from 1590 - 1593. It was the citadel of the armies of four foreign powers: Spain 🇪🇸 from 1571 to 1898; Great Britain 🇬🇧  from 1762 through 1764 during the Seven Year War; United States 🇺🇸 from 1898 to 1946; and the Empire of Japan 🇯🇵 from 1942 through 1945 during the Second World War. It was declared a National Shrine and a National Monument in 1951 and as a National Cultural Treasure in 2014.     The marker, Last Walk to Martyrdom Trail, a centennial freedom trail characterized by the shoe prints of Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal, memorializes the path he took to Bagumbayan from his cell in Fort Santiago in the early hours of December 30, 1896. It symbolizes the birth of the Filipino nation. The marker was unveiled on December 27, 1996 during the incumbency of His Excellency President Fidel V. Ramos.      Another point of interest for me was the Postigo de la Nuestra Señora de Soledad, a postern used as access from Fort Santiago to the Pasig River, from whence Lieutenant General Simon de Anda, leader of the Spanish Resistance against the British Occupation of Manila from 1762 through 1768 during the Seven Year War after a siege of Intramuros by the British Army.      A white stone cross marks the final resting place of approximately 600 Filipinos and Americans who were victims of atrocities including starvation and possibly suffocation by the Japanese Imperial Forces, during the last days of February 1945, who were found inside a nearby dungeon which had inner doors of massive iron bars and outer doors of iron plates on wood.",Pat r,"Visiting Fort Santiago is going through the different phases of Philippine history. The Spanish architecture of the buildings reminds us of Spain’s colonial rule, which heavily influenced the Philippine culture and psyche, making the country a unique country in Asia for having a lot of things in common with the Latin world and Europe. The prison cell and museum for Jose Rizal provided an educational tour about his life. His trial room, and the depiction of his footsteps from his prison cell going to where he would be executed enriched my understanding about his life. The museum about Intramuros, Manila’s walled city had the miniature models of the grand, gorgeous buildings which Manila had, before the bombings during World War II destroyed them all and they were never rebuilt. Much of Manila was destroyed during the war, but most of the colonial buildings were never rebuilt. The museum gave us a glimpse of Manila’s glorious past which was destroyed during the war.The place is great for students for their school trips, and also for tourists. There were lots of greenery, especially mango trees. The buildings and the gate are great for photos. The restrooms needed improvement though, but the entrance fee was cheap at 75 pesos. Overall, I love the place.",Luz C,"Worth seeing, in the Intramuros. Good views and interesting historically.  Not necessary to book a tour. ",Makoto,"Beautiful place, so clean and many scenic areas, good opportunities for vacation photos. Very affordable, only paid 75 pesos to go in, about US$1.50. Well worth the visit.",Bernadine S,"Fort Santiago is a treasure in the middle of the historic district. Wide open for exploration, study or rest. The exhibits on patriot Rizal are impressive and well worth the time to explore, plus it will get you out of the sun for a half-hour. The site is well maintained, although its past is full of mystery due to the colonizing interests of so many nations. This is a highlight for Old Manila.",Mambo305,Place is well maintained. I could see that the 75 peso entrance is worth it. Their guards wesr the spanish time uniform of guardia sibil. Lights at night are awesome! A good place to roam when you are for history. The dungeon as what is hyped nowadays is not that amazing and you get to spend a few minutes due to the number of people visiting. Ugh. ,Alan L,This one will make you see the history of Rizal and Manila. A lot of things to see and learn from and would make you want to comeback in the future,Nico Samneil Sy Salado,"When you go to Intramuros, the old town of Manila, then of course you also must see Fort Santiago. Nice for a walk. ",dongjerms
4,Resorts World Manila,Casinos,No Data,0,"Newport Blvd Newport City, Pasay, Luzon 1309 Philippines",Didn't expect that the casino had a small mall on the second level! Was able to shop quickly before I left for my flight.,Mr Prinz,You can find luxury goods here... enjoyed the event that was currently in the mall center that time. we had good food by barcino's and dessert at crisostomo's. ,Fred,"We were impressed at the huge complex built here in Newport City so close to Manila International Airport. With the Runway Manila walkway opened the casino complex is only a 20 minute walk from your plàne. If that is too much to walk there is a complimentary shuttle that runs 24/7 from the runway terminus. On the Runway there is a Resorts Casino booth and it is there you should make your first stop. The friendly employees will copy your passport picture onto your loyalty card which they will give you right then and there along with 500 pp in free play and a free gift ( some casino swag). With the loyalty card you can also get 300 pp every year on your birthday. The casino complex is mega with a hotel, several restaurants, a shopping mall, a coffee shop and a bar.the main casino is at ground level but there are more gaming areas upstairs especially high roller rooms. No photography allowed inside the casino, the pictures we took were at the entrance and the Chinese New Years decorations in the casino. The casino is mostly (80%) geared to Chinese clientele. There are table games we have never seen in the States but from what we heard you stand a better chance to win. The slot machines were not too tight. No longer free cocktails; don't know if soft drinks are still free. While we were there no cocktail waitress approached us.Therw was a large bar in the middle of the room. We were told there is nightly free live entertainment. Regretfully no dance floor. Rest rooms were spotless but only one location and that is next to the Cage.  The casino appeared clean and well ventilated. Did not appear to be too smokey. The furnishings may be a bit dated. We are used to American casinos with dim lighting so this one with the bright ceiling lights was a bit off putting at first. Perhaps this is how the Chinese gamblers prefer. All throughout the casino employees are extremely friendly. This extends to the security guards",MountaineerLu,"The mall is like a city within a city.....lots of hotels, designer shops and excellent restaurants to choose from. Some section of the mall is being repaired due to a terrifying incident that happened few years ago. The mall is clean and beautiful.",Tenkid,"A bit smokey at times - usual run  of amenities and distractions - convenient to several hotels at various price ranges,+",Fr. Bruce,"High end shops and plenty of restaurants. Close proximity to NAIA 3, can walk to airport using walkway.",ed M,Very well run properly very professional staff courteous polite want to help you nothing is too much travel very clean very tidy a big yes,Hammer13,"A great place to spend a few hours between flights. Also good if you have a overnight stay for a connecting flight.Full of high end shopping, casinos , movie complexes, their is a bit to see and do. Food is fantastic at a'lot of the eateries.  Not cheap though.",Darryn,"Although it’s a magnet for casino lovers, there are also a myriad of activities for those who will not play at the casino. Although I don’t play casino, I just took a look of the casino floor. It’s vast and high-end, and taking photos is prohibited.The complex has restaurants and shopping, where the prices are exponentially high if you compare to other parts of Manila.

",Iya Q.,"If you are visiting Manila, Intramuros is one of the places to go and explore. We were in the city for 24h and hotel staff recommended to visit, so we got a hotel-taxi (45mins from BCG to Intramuros, may take longer depending on traffic) and had an enjoyable afternoon. Intramuros is the old town and the building style is very much European. You can easily walk around the streets, there is little traffic, mostly bike-taxis that offer to take you on a guided tour. Since we needed some exercise we walked around the old fort and city walls (rather wear closed shoes than flip-flops, little bit dirty and there may be a rainpour). We started our walking tour at Fort Santiago and walked down to Rizal Park and back, visiting the Basilika Menore (a cathedral that had been destroyed 7 times through war or earthquakes and rebuild 8 times) and walked along the city walls. The streets are full of business, students and merchants, curio shops, street food and large governmental offices. We felt safe spending time there. Some of the bike-guides were a bit nagging but a friendly repeat-'No, thank you' did the job. Unfortunately we had no time to visit any of the museums but there is so much history to explore here (colonialism, WWII, post war era, ...). We spent 2.5h in Intramuros and it gave us a good impression of another part of this city, one that is not spick-and-span and glitzy with flashing lights but rather one that is full of friendly faces, local food and a lot of history.

What's worst is that, the security team here looks like they dont know what they're doing. There are 2 counters with multiple lines!! Online purchase of tickets will also cost you more!! They charge 100 pesos per ticket purchased online for convenince fee to undergo their inconvenient process!!! It was my first time to watch here and will be my last. The seating areangement also doesnt have leg room! If you book a seat at the middle of the row, the only way to get to your seat without bumping another person is by flying!

We had the fried Lumpia with pork and shrimp, which was very good, the fresh lumpia and the lumpia gulay. The last one was good, but not as good as the others. All came with a different dipping sauce. This is part of a chain and we were happy with our choice. Opening hours follow mall hours, so check before going. Because of the virus, staff are wearing masks and your temperature is taken upon entering the mall.

Probably because of worries about theft, Filipino supermarkets have not introduced self service checkouts. The cashier was very slow and did not have a male packer to assist her.  However the supermarket has a very good range.  Try to shop here at 1000 in the morning ehen there are no queues.Security guards all speak English and immediately can inform shoppers where individual stores are, but there is also computerised display board information.The MRT elevated railway Line 1 is an easy walk along Pedro Gil Street.",Craig R,Me and my husband goes here whenever we are in Manila because it is the closest in our office. This mall is complete from out favorite restaurant to my favorite massage parlor and shopping. ,Victorianlad,"The reason i am giving Robinsons Mall such a high rating over SM is because of its customer service. As a Canadian, the customer service was so much better than SM.More importantly, you can use your 11 pin foreign bank card password at Robinsons or any other restaurants and Bank of Manila card machine but you cant use it at SM and BDO card machines. SM kept on asking me for my bank cards but Canadians always use 11 pin password for privacy concerns. Robinsons is okay with 11 pins but SM is not. So SM sucks and Robinsons is the best. ",HHS,"Robinson Mall has been here for years. It has grown and expanded. It is easy to get lost in and come out a different entrance than where you came in. I use my GPS to get around. There are money changers, cellphone stores, food courts, full service restaurants, little shops and large international brand shops like Marks and Spencer and Body Shop. Parking underneath, movie theaters and a full service spa and Massage as well s a gym. But the prices are reasonable here not like some other malls in Manila. Safe and security at all entrances ",HaveFoodyWillTravel,"This is one of the most confusing malls I have ever see - easy to get lost but in a good way.

Upon arriving the airport go straight towards right side of the building there you can see signs leading you to the fascinating pedestrian. There were also fast foods and restaurant along the side.

Newport City houses several hotels which are just across the road from the airport, and offers excellent accommodation especially for those who want to avoid traffic jams on their way to the airport. The hotel would just be a few minutes walk to the airport. The restaurants at Terminal 3 offers more affordable meals compared to the restaurants at Newport City. If you stay at any of the hotels at Newport City and you prefer more affordable meals, you can leisurely pass through the pedestrian bridge and get a meal at one of the restos at NAIA Terminal 3. ",Makoto,"Whoever thought of putting in this pedestrian short cut from Newport City to Terminal 3 of Manila Airport was a genius. It opened up that development to airport traffic as well as opening up all the airport eateries on level 4 to people in Newport. The main reason was to get traffic to the casinos there especially Resorts World and it works. There is a booth halfway across the bridge where you can sign up for Resorts World loyalty program. The pedestrian walkway is air conditioned, there are moving walkways and golf carts to take you across upon request no charge, no tip expected but gladly accepted.Two sets of security checkpoints coming from Newport so you feel safe. There are restrooms, good signs and it is well lit. Perhaps one could have preferred more subdued mood lighting at night for tired travelers but that is not a major consideration. There are elevators on both ends and luggage carts are available at no charge. At the Newport side there is a plethora of shuttle busses available (free) to take passengers to the hotels, restaurants and casinos there. They run 24 hours a day and are free. Unless you have a large amount of luggage most of the destinations bin Newport can be walked to in less than 10-15 minutes. The walk is pleasant and the neighborhood very safe. It would be nice if the other terminals in NAIA were connected to Runway Manila.",MountaineerLu,"My boyfriend needed to get a haircut at Bruno's Barber so we had to went out of the airport before our flight. From NAIA Terminal 3, we walked at the Runway and had a ride shuttle ride for free to New Port City. The shuttle leaves every 30 minutes.

With a bad cough and start of a cold, and desperately needed a pharmacy.   The nearest one was Watson’s in the Resorts World complex.   I then noticed that the Runway, footbridge was open.

The best way to visit the church is to buy a ticket to the museum and see both the church and museum on your visit.  Trust me, you will not want to visit just one.  You’ll need at least a few hours to see both.  I had absolute complete freedom to roam anywhere on the property including up to the magnificent organ room on the upper level of the church.

I spent a few hours on the entire property including the church.  There are two beautiful gardens on the property.  Be sure and look for the turtles in the inner garden fountain.  Don’t get too close to the fountain because they’ll swim underwater.  They appear to be shy and very aware of people.  ,Steven T,"The museum was a wealth of history that traced back to the Spanish landing in Philippines.  It was unfortunate that it was heavily damaged during WWII and many of the treasures were destroyed but the church and grounds were rebuilt.  What relics and important artifacts that were saved, salvaged or returned to the church were displayed in a number of different temperature controlled rooms.  A lot were lost.  Paintings of saints and retablos (altars) lined the walkways with windows that over looked the courtyard.The central garden courtyard was green and popular for group photos while the gardens in the back,  accessed through the gift shop, was more secluded and nice for a contemplative walk.The crypt was unique with no matching niches.  The famous painter, Juan Luna, was interred here.I recommend going to the second floor where the choir sits near the organ.  From that vantage point one could look down onto the main church floor and the altar.  The ornate ceiling was actually like a painting.

Very big museum that went into great detail about St. Augustine, the monks, and the impact on the Philippines.  We have visited museums like this in Europe, but this was less crowded and more informative.  English was used throughout the museum.",Daniel D,"If you're into seeing religious relics, then this museum within the church complex is for you. The entrance fee is a bit higher compared to other attractions within Intramuros. The whole complex is air-conditioned, so it's a good opportunity to cool down after venturing on a sight-seeing tour in the area.

Happy 2020 Solaire Team.",Paradise35141352471,"Last January 7 (between 5-7pm), I was shopping in the G/F at the Sky Tower of Solaire (building annex connected to Solaire Main Hotel) when suddenly I saw some management staff plus firemen carrying extinguishers rushing to the elevator. When I (with other shoppers/employers) was trying to access the elevator to go to parking, they blocked us off and said the elevators are temporarily not accessible. So naturally, I proceeded to the FIRE EXIT to make my way to 3/F, a security lady blocked me and asked me to stay in the G/F. Worried, I was asking security what is happening some would say-1. ""we cannot confirm""2. ""Secret""3. Fire broke out in one of the floors4. "" stay inside foe your safety"" FIRE?!?!?! If it did, then WHY DID I NOT HEAR any fire alarms? And Why are we not allowed to access the FIRE EXIT???After 30mins of waiting within the lobby area. Security was directing us to go outside, at the docking area of the Sky Tower Building. Again, I still dont hear fire alarms.Slowly, I see building employees (of companies renting in the SKY Tower as all would have building IDs. BUT notable, i did not see hotel and casino guests being evacuated. You can see in the video below majority would have building IDs.While outside, they just asked us to wait. NO security marshalls and no building staff announcing any general advise regarding the matter. And no directions or lines being instructed for us to follow, which I am expecting from a 5 star hotel building. I saw some young folks who are trying to video the moment and I security swarming towards them asking videos to be deleted. They were even shouting and threatening one yound lady that theyd bring her to security office and BAN HER in Solaire hotel and casino.Then firetrucks begin to arrive. Hmmm and they still wont divulge what is happening?!?!?Thoughts on this-1. If THIS WERE a fire drill. Why wasnt there an alarm triggered? Why was evacuation being selective? And if it were a fire drill, sorry to say but super bad handling.2. If there was really fire? Even small and on one floor only, why wasnt there any alarms triggered to the WHOLE BUILDING3. What if it worsened? Is that only time you will trigger the alarm4. Why were we not ALLOWED to use FIRE EXITShortly afrer 7pm, they allowed us to go out. Sharing some pics below",Jay A

It's not just the pickpockets but the online scams with foreigners too.Other scams are that a Filipina want to take a trip making the foreigners think they will be in a relationship but end communication after the girl gets her trip.They fabricate, alter, and falsify the truth.

It is not a practical condition since kids are not allowed all the rides.About their Snow World: I got very irked with the manner they handle the ""need to buy their gloves, ear muffs and mask"".  As soon as you get into the gate, you will have to pass by their sales rep who keeps on explaining (per group of people or per family) the need for such items...and collects payment there. Thus, taking a lot of time just to pass that spot.  And when we're able to get in..just before they open the metal door inside, the gatekeeper will explain again the need for such items...and keeps on asking for anyone who wants the items...and collects payment (while we're all wearing their thick jacket...and yes, we're sweating inside) .

The entrance and rides fees are affordable! ,Jane T,for only 500PHP you can ride all you want and the lines are not that long.  Most of the rides are older carnival rides that were assembled indoors but still a fun afternoon.,jtmandelbaum,"This has been a playground of people from all walks of life and age. For the young ones and those who have no vertigo and heart problems can ride the Surfdance, rhe Star Frisbee and the Star Flyer to their hearts content. Only those people who are willing to accept G-forces and have a high tolerance for speed and high centrifugal motions can very well hold up to the thrill, the blood surge and excitement of inverted flight in these rides. However for the young ONCE who have now physical liabilities there are rides that are compatible to our advancing age called the slow rotating Ferris Wheel.

You will definitely enjoy by just being there.",ynadqnor,"Need to upgrade the food court, the place is not good to eat the atmosphere is hot and fly are everywhere.",epilef a,"The star city grounds is pretty much the same as it has always been. The great thing about this place is that it is within the city and is accessible by public transport. What we liked about our recent visit were the games (although we hardly won anything), the snow world and the trick eye place where you can tale some fun photos.Tips:1. If you are not good with games, you can save more money by just buying stuffed toys from the stalls2. If you will try out the winter / snow place, bring socks along because you will be asked to wear the shoes that they lend3. In the snow place, better bring your own winter clothes because the ones they have are filthy. Also bring your masks and gloves.

Good thing I had my own jacket.",Weng845,"Its a fun place, but the day we went waa crowded with young school kids there was no place to breath. It has lot of restricted rides for small kids due to hight. But again it was a fun place for kids.",Ice Flores,"I booked tickets through travelbook (for a much lesser price) and brought the confirmation from my mobile. Upon redemption, they asked me to send the confirmation via email which I felt was time consuming and inefficient. Anyway, we were able to get through and had a fun day. You can bring food and drinks but there are plenty of stores inside and they are affordable. Try to arrive early (as soon as it opens) to avoid long lines especially on outdoor rides. They are strict about height restrictions as well.We tried Snow World and I had to pay additional 170 pesos per person. The pay includes a worn winter jacket which you have to run once you get out for other people to wear. They mask for Php20 and Gloves for Php60. They sell hot chocolate and coffee inside for Php30-45. It was very cold and the slide was fun. They don't allow guest to take pictures using their gadgets and pictures were worth Php100 per photo. They official photographers who will take pictures at specific areas. You can claim the photos after 1-2 hours.  The ice sculptures were big but werent very impressive. Some parts were melted already. The Php170 ticket allows you unlimited entry on the same day. They also have Adventure Zone. Its right beside Star City but you need to pay additional fees. Star City offers Php490 for ride all you can and Php 440 for three rides only. They dont sell tickets for individual rides.",Khalid D,"Tourist and Consumer grab. If they wanted to attract consumers, then charge just for the rides not the entry fee. Also, unlimited ride tickets costing almost the same price as a 3 ride ticket is absurd. And no individual ride tickets is ridiculous. To make things worse, lining up in the hot and humid heat for a ride is so unpleasant especially when the line ups are so long and fenced off with reinforced steel fences should an emergency occur. A bad incident is waiting to happen. Don't get me wrong the rides  were fun but the set up was wrong. The Star Amusement  was a disappointment. Go to the Ferris Wheel at the MOA. It's less hectic and a lot cheaper.",alessia2017,"It's a huge amusement park with lots of different rides for kids or teenagers, adult and a big play area for toddlers.

We stayed at all three hotels.  The Hyatt was the oldest of the three, the least expensive, and the most crowded.  We had a unattractive street and city view with a swampy parking lot below filled with strange milky looking water.  On the plus side there was a nice pool area, great shower, good air conditioning, comfortable double beds, lots of towels in the bathroom, and a night light.  Put your room card in the slot by the door to turn on the lights. We did not see complimentary water and the water price was hidden in the drawer.  There is no ice bucket or ice machine.  We ordered some ice from room service that came in a bowl.  Toiletries were in an ugly little box on counter.  They do offer a free shuttle to Mall of Asia that runs from 11:00 am until 2:00 am.  There was a small fruit platter with an apple, orange and pear.  No plate with knife and fork. We went online to book a room for an additional night though we just needed it for a few hours before a late flight.  We saw online that there was space available.  My husband went downstairs to book the room and was told to go back to his room and dial 0.  He did and was told to go downstairs.  Also because we booked the first room online through a third party (hotels.com) the Hyatt did not count our stay as part of their frequent visitor program.  Our second room was nicer and larger than the first with a garden view.  The lobby was extremely smoky and disorganized.  Casino is extremely busy Friday and Saturday nights. Luckily we met a very nice representative at the airport.  He was the best thing about the hotel.  He helped arrange our transport to and from the hotel and waited with us at the airport until we were safely aboard the shuttle.  Note of all three hotels at City of Dreams the Hyatt had the lowest airport transportation $50 US versus $80 US from Nobu.  Decent accommodations.  Ask for a garden view.",Kathleen H,"This buffet has it all. Seafood, Filipino food, casual food. Atmosphere is nice and quiet enough to have good conversations.

We had a few not-so-good experiences, but overall, it was pleasant.",Mark Evangelista PWD,"I have a few things to point out.  The brief stay was good and not so good in some aspects which I will write below and let you decide The GOOD:Hotel room, amenities and view - Great! Service - friendly and accommodating staff who assisted us during check-in; even gave my wife a bday cake to celebrate the occasionRestaurants - the food truck park was a hit with all of and offers you variety of food and drinks, some of our favorite dishes were available and allowed my wife and I to try a couple of new restaurantsPool area and gardens - quite nice to stroll and walk around, it was drizzling but I really liked the use of spaceThe NOT-SO-GOOD:- going to and from the food park to the hotel, you have to walk around the casino area where the smell of smoke was nauseating and I was actually surprised people were walking with small kids and even infants in strollers around this area.  Health hazard (funny that the NO SMOKING sign was quite visibly posted on the pillars around the casino floor :)- my son and I wanted to go for a swim, usually my son wears his board shorts and a dri-fit shirt which the pool attendants had to verify with me since it is quite fitting for my son who was on the chubby side that it could be mistaken for a rashguard, the material was almost similar - however, they only allow rashguard attire or barenaked for men.  Disappointed, my son and I just decided to forego the swim and walked back up to the room.  Take note of this to avoid disappointment- I was not satisfied with the number of food choices in the breakfast buffet.  The reason I did not gave this review a POOR rating, the staycation was still fun and quite memorable because of the people you spend it with.  All the rest are extra!",remicharlene,"You know, I want to go out of my way to say just how awesome this place is! My wife and I just got back from a two night trip and I can't say enough about the Resorts World Manila. Huge casino. Awesome slots. So many slots actually. Comparable to Las Vegas in quantity in that regard. But the best thing for me was the casino staff. I had a few drinks on my last night and was high fiving and cheering at the baccarrat tables and I wasnt obnoxious or anything, but I was loud and energetic. All the dealers were cool with me and therefore I tipped from time to time.The hotel security never once came over to tell me to keep it down and I mention this because there have been a lot of reviews suggesting that the casino security is heavy handed. ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. They were great. They let me have fun, win or lose. Also there are so many amazing restaurants both at the casino level and in the mall. You simply don't need to leave the place.

As a Hyatt rewards program member, we have always been given a complimentary suite upgrade. The Hotel has a casino, shopping, restaurants, and you never need to leave.

19,Okada Manila Resort & Casino,Casinos,"A US$2.4 billion development sprawled in a 44-hectare premium property at the heart of Manila’s fast-rising Entertainment City, Okada Manila sets the new gold standard for five-star luxury. Iconic in its grandeur and lavishly executed in every detail, it is unprecedented in its bold take on elegance and sophistication. As Manila Bay’s crown jewel, Okada Manila is the newest and grandest gaming and entertainment destination in Asia. From its sinfully sumptuous suites and villas, to its award-winning cuisine prepared by expert chefs, to the region’s first indoor beach club, to the prestige brands on offer at its retail glass corridor. And its stunning centerpiece: the grand musical fountain, which rivals other spectacular fountains in Dubai and Las Vegas. The fountain stands as a monument to Okada Manila’s grand vision of building what will perhaps become one of the wonders of the modern world. Breaking new ground with its many distinct innovations, Okada Manila expertly combines advanced technology, top-class amenities, environment-friendly architectural planning, and world-class entertainment options—topped with the kind of exemplary service that personifies a unique blend of Japanese hospitality and Filipino warmth. Okada Manila is the flagship development of Tiger Resort, Leisure and Entertainment, Inc., which in turn is a subsidiary of Japan’s Universal Entertainment Corporation (UEC), a world leader in the design and manufacture of gaming machines.Read more",0,"New Seaside Drive Entertainment City, Paranaque, Luzon 1701 Philippines","So I was staying at okada last night with my family when a guard harassed me, asked for my ID and everything. We're about to take a dinner but they disturbed us and held me in a secluded office where everybody were just a male security guards for more than an hour. They didn't allowed my boyfriend to escort me inside and the head of security looks like a boasting maniac. They accused me for room selling when my other account was just hacked by a scammer. I understand what they are saying but at least they should investigate first before saying that I will be banned in the premises. I'm going to sue that security and make sure everyone will pay. That is harassment.",Blessie A,This will be my best hotel experience.  Staff members were courteous... I was amazed by the huge jacuzzi inside the room.  The only thing i missed is the swimming pool because it was closed due to pandemic.  Looking forward to come back again!,Kriss R,"It was truly a relaxing momeny. I got a chance to experience world-class spa. I truly admire the ambiance because it was so grand, expensive and peaceful.",Ivaylo Ivanov,"We had such an amazing experience staying at this hotel. Antigen testing was smooth and we were able to check in right after getting the results. The staffs are all nice and greets you whenever they see you. Our Executive Suite is super nice, and the view is really amazing. It's really worth it! Breakfast is also good, and we had it in-room since buffet is closed, but still loved it, and it's safer! They also surprised us with an anniversary banner and cake which is soooo sweet. Thank you so much, Okada for this lovely experience. We'll definitely come back and recommend you to our friends!❤️❤️❤️",Elisa Fantillo,"With all of the COVID restrictions, my wife and I have not been able to take our 6-month-old son anywhere. We were very excited to learn that we could come to the Okada for a staycation! A lot of the restaurants and amenities are currently closed, including the fountain, but we still thoroughly enjoyed our stay!  From all of our inquiries before our stay to our arrival and throughout our stay, everything was wonderful.  We arrived to the incredibly helpful staff who valeted our car, took our luggage, and escorted us to the check-in desk. We completed COVID tests upon arrival, which were done very quickly.  We were then shown to our room, to which we found we were upgraded to an incredible suite, and our luggage arrived shortly after.  We had an issue with some of the lights in our unit not turning off the first night, but the problem was corrected the next day.  It was so nice to be able to walk around the property with our son.  Even sitting at the Starbucks felt like such a luxury!  The property did get crowded on Saturday and Sunday, with a lot of large events taking place and day guests coming to visit.  I will say that those guests do not require COVID tests, so it seems a little silly that you are required to have one only if you are spending the night.Nonetheless, our stay was wonderful and in particular, I would like to call out Timothy from the pool bar, Yussep from guest services, Rea from the concierge, Chris at the front door, and Jeffrey from guest services who all made our stay wonderful.  We hope to be back soon!",Ivaylo Ivanov,They’re good at surprises. Booked ahead of time for a 2-night stay to spend our first Valentine’s celebration as a married couple. All our booking requests which they confirmed and agreed to upon booking were ALL disregarded without any notice. Just found out that none were accommodated upon checking in to our room. What a surprise. I guess they’re living with they’re objective on making your experience memorable—in a bad way. Spent our first day just waiting for updates and follow ups. What a waste of time and money. So disappointing.  We are supposed to be relaxing now. but here I am writing a review about our bad experience on our day 1 at Okada.,Marga E,"I highly recommend this place. Exceptional service is the reason why I keep on coming back. From their front desk , room service and most especially the pool area. Would like to really commend Sarah and Menard from the pool area, very effective and efficient. They’re very polite and accommodating. Simply love this place. Kudos for having a great team.",Ivaylo Ivanov,Highly recommended to all family and friends that want to unwind and relax. We had a great experience because of the staff at Coral Wing Pool specially at the Pool Bar staff tim and sarah they keep us entertain and they are very accommodating they are serving different kinds of cocktails that will made your day and food is also excellent!!!! The safety protocols are also followed here.,Ben Heyman,"My mother in law got a complimentary stay here today and we are really amazed with all the hotel staff because you really feel their kindness! I forgot the name of the Front desk staff who assisted us but she was very kind and explained everything we would need to know without even asking first. I should know because I work in other Hotel. 😉 I want to commend especially those friendly staffs at the Pool Bar located at the swimming pool namely Timothy, He’s really nice and so approachable. He even offered us to take our beautiful photos there and He told us some good insights about the Hotel. Menard, Neil, Jothan and Paul are also nice and very accommodating! 👍🏻Everything in the Room is controlled by an IPad. From the Lightings, AC, TV, Map, Minibar, etc! This is really awesome experience for us! Plus the sanitation and cleanliness are also great! Overall our stay was really superb! 👍🏻😘Thank you, Okada Manila!❤️We should go back! 👍🏻☺️",Sia,"Okada Pool Bar has the amenities we are looking for, kid friendly and the staff are attentive to all our needs. Outstanding service (esp. Timothy) and the place is TOPS. We will soon be back. ",Ivaylo Ivanov,"My partner and I booked the Okada hotel for one night before our long haul flight the following day. Having travelled around for three weeks, we wanted a bit of luxury before returning to the UK; Okada did not deliver. Upon arrival we were surprised that our luggage was searched numerous times, but understood the need for security. We arrived at 5pm when our designated check-in was 3pm, to be advised our room was not yet ready. The receptionist began by saying we could use the spa or sit in the bar and wait. We were not offered any complementary treatments or even a drink, just simply told you will have to wait the room is not ready. After much back and forth we were told ten minutes to wait, which seemed slightly odd considering she had originally advised we go and get a spa treatment whilst we wait. The room itself was nice, however had a very strong smell of petrol fumes. We turned off the aircon unit but this made no difference. When we returned to the room and got into bed around midnight, I discovered a patch of blood on the sheet that had clearly not come from either of us. This explained why we were originally told the room was not ready, then it was suddenly ready within ten minutes. Quite clearly the bed sheets were not changed before our stay. We felt physically sick. This is utterly disgusting service from a '5*' hotel. We had to call house keeping to change the bed, and again we were not offered anything to compensate for such poor service. Would not recommend. ",Gel C,"I went to Okada. They did not let me enter with my backpack. I came from my layover flight and decided to go to casino to gamble. My backpack is a Gucci brand and it was 2000usd. I don't feel safe checking in my backpack, they want me to check in my backpack or else i cannot enter. I have my documents and many business credit cards and a small business laptop. I do not feel safe checking in my backpack. I want to carry it with me for peace of mind. It’s a small backpack. Why can't i enter? this is a very bad experience for me. I've been to many casino before, and this is the first time i cannot enter with my bag.",Sophie Emma,"Okada Manila, can be seen along coastal road.

Kudos!!! Thank you okada!!!,Ivaylo Ivanov,"Every casino in the world, from las vegas to atlantic city, to monte carlo, to macau, to Resort World Manila allows customers to carry their backpack. It's common sense.Only Okada does not allow it. I goto casino, I carry valueables in my backpack; passport, credit cards, medicine pills, glasses, cash, high denomination chips, cellphones, chargers.After going to security scanner xray machine, and nothing malicious found, I goto the casino floor, but the security says ""no backpack allowed"" The security guard wanted me to ""check-in"" my backpack. I said, why would I check in my backpack? I have all my valueable items that I carry with me at all times. He says that I have to put my items in my pockets. So while I play baccarat or slot machine, I have 2 big cellphones in my jeans. my passport id will bend. This is uncomfortable. Security guard says backpack is allowed only if u have bundles of cash.so now every time I goto Okada, I have bundles of cash, just so I can enter. The security must see that cash. He wants to see. This is awkard and privacy invasive. So now if you see a person with a backpack in Okada, it means theyre carrying hundreds of thousands. It makes them a target (to be followed to parking etc). Do u see whats wrong here? Why does Okada make such rule? whats the purpose? why don't you have a meeting and re evaluate your protocols.thank u",Carol O,"Just went to view the Dancing Fountains, and it was fantastic.It's amazing how those fountains swing in tune with Aerosmith's ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing . . .""I think they have these shows every Christmas Season (have to check this). Better bring a really good video camera, with a zoom lens.",Ivaylo Ivanov,"Sometimes, it's the best things in Life that are Free. That's the impression one can get watching the Fountain Show at Okada Manila.Okada Manila's welcoming ambiance is expressed in its Pink Colors - definitely elegant and could never be mistaken for tacky. The hotel's layout design is best appreciated as it draws visitors to its attractions (immediately the Fountain Show) rather than building a crowd in its lounge/ reception area which is common for most hotels.  Exiting the hotel as well offers the same revelation - no throng of guests waiting to exit out albeit seemingly slow valet services.",FellowTraveler796017,"As far as entertainment & fun is what you've been looking for...this is the place to be. Nothing compares the ambiance, cozy and elegance on this place.... a nice spot to visit.",Eric john A,"I am a half korean/English/American but have pale skin obv I have the eyes. In Manila I was asked may times a day if I was Filipino which I wouldn’t mind, but shocked cause growing up it would always be Chinese Japanese korean never Once. I might be used to Las Vegas right professionalism when it comes to taking bet paying out chips in cash etc. where am I going. I’m 32 I could pass for 21 I felt like there’s a misconception that a young person like me doesn’t have that much money or they think I’m Filipino or white. As a dealer when I sat down was very nice prob my age was in shock I obv don’t look like the avg Asian as he said. He said I know your Asian but it’s like your white I never seen this before. Also the guards getting in were rude it was like they were told to try and give attitudes to people they feel don’t have money so they won’t come back. I swear changing into a nice button down expensive jeans i saw a difference. I carried a bag man purse guard looks in and my passport 5000 usd and 100,000 peso stack. Attitude changed. More things seem to confirm it when I go back as I’m staying at resorts world I was coming for poker game then would gamble. No one was in line to go through metal detectors and I stand there unzip my bag and instead of the swift hand upfront  and back not touching far out to see bulge and used stick. And she gave me this attitude out of nowhere and nudge me i only went inch but she check by back side again and it’s her angry face. Now I’m saved by a guard who saw my money previous day and she tells the guard to stop it’s ok and looks down smiling. I only game there cuz there was poker action which even the floors managers will tell you it was because of me regulars showed up. There is something in Filipino culture or the casino wants to keep a certain kind of person out as I didn’t want special treatment but so many rude  responses to simple questions. It might be they don’t realize they are not only in service industry but an industry where people are losing Money. This is a complaint as a whole not complaining about specific person etc. I will be returning and would love to play poker there but also take breaks and play 100,000 php at baccarat then go back as playing poker even though it’s raked out of principle I couldn’t lose money to people being rude.  I also would never complain about a person and have there job possibly in harm but what recourse does any employee from okada suggest I do if I’m getting these nasty vibes from floor men dealers. What is funny my personality is the type to go get 1million pesos and walk right in front of the guy that was rude to me. But I’m Las Vegas it’s easier with $20,000 usd then 1million pesos.  I wanted to end with some sarcasm and I don’t want anything don’t need anything but I’d like to hear from an employee because these casinos were built specifically for a certain race/culture and high rollers I know real high rollers and I didn’t see any I saw 10,000 peso max bet tables. I’ll stop im just upset because minus the interaction I like the layout over  Solaire besides there suites there casino is nothing special.’Okada was built great and I’d like to play there. Hopefully there’s a response with in 2 weeks. I fly in korean airlines Ny business if you wanna send a car? Kidding.",Ivaylo Ivanov

As a westerner not used to such a busy atmosphere it was a little overwhelming. After getting used to it I can't wait to go back again. ",Indy27,"I come to Megamall quite often as it is close to home and has most of the things I need at about a 10-15 minute walk away. Last visit was Jan. 10, 2019 (or yesterday as I am currently writing this). These are the major observations I've made:a.) When a lot of people come to Megamall to shop, you'll know as traffic becomes super congested and it is hard to get around even if the mall isn't exactly where you need to be. b.) Guards can be a little too pushy when they are inspecting bags to the point where one guard yanked my bag towards her just to poke the wooden stick they all hold into my bag. Guards have jobs to do but this doesn't give them the right to be that rude towards customers.c.) Most bathrooms often have one or two stalls that contain toilets which don't flush properly or don't contain enough toilet tissue.d.) Sales assistants in their department store do one of two things: Stand around talking to each other zoning out or hound their customers to get tags or codes off products or transaction numbers from receipts just so they can get commission that they don't deserve because they didn't actually do anything to be helpful. e.) With as many shops as Megamall has my boyfriend and I find that there are still some shops that Megamall does not have that we have seen in numerous other malls around the Metro. Some examples of stores we have searched for are: Digital Walker, Hobbes & Landes,  Baskin Robbins and Henry's Camera.Though there are many shops to go to and quite a few things to do here there is still a lot of room for improvement.",Ryan,"This shopping centre is a one stop shop that has everything to keep families entertained for hours.

My two teenagers went around to shop and do ice skating.There’s a cinema, a grocery store , food halls/courts and  a variety of restaurants that will cater to your taste weather it is Italian, Japanese, French, Western fast food , Mexican or local Filipino cuisine.

It’s such a happy place for me that I didn’t have to leave the place because it has everything in it. It has a wide selection of restaurants, cafes, bars, and a couple of retail stores, convenience stores, and gyms. The mall hours are a bit late compared to other malls in the metro but I don’t mind because then you have somewhere to go after work even if you’re caught up in traffic.

The older buildings host mostly dining places and fast food restaurants.The newer infrastructures host call centers, department stores , offices and  grocery stores.The bottom line is this is located near the center of the Metro. It is accessible from the Antipolo, Montalban, Mandaluyong, Rizal and most areas.The only problem here is the traffic during weekends since a major highway (C-5) traverses the area.I suggest be here after lunch so you could park your car effortlessly and wait till sundown to take your dinner here. There are also live bands in the evening. But loud music stops by 10 pm to follow  local ordinances. There is no casino here so this is good for family outlings, like reunion, anniversaries , baptism or weddings.There is an air-conditioned church within the complex. It is ideal of weddings.If you are the religious type, there is another church near the area, a pilgrimage church  for Saint Father Pio believers.It is located near a gasoline station but come early Sunday for parking convenience. The church is crowded but there are flat screens that monitor the masses inside if you could not make it inside the church. So you may take your lunch here since you have only to walk from the church.Everything is here--food, drinks, live band, entertainment, supermarket, cinemas....name it.

We stayed in her flat for x number of years, but never got any help with the leaks, clogging drainage, and always broken water pipes. We requested once, but it took us a serious amount of time chasing her, so in our years of stay, we just spent on everything that we need that is supposedly under contract should have been shouldered by the broker-herself/owner. Before we left the place, she told us to repair the parts of the house that we have damaged because they are not part of the expenses she should shoulder based on the contract , and understandably, we hired our own contractor and did the fixing. We did this as she promised to return the deposit if we did; however the same thing that happened to another expat, she just lied and never gave our deposit back! She mentioned that we have damaged more stuff in the house and nothing will be left from our money. The first few weeks we moved to her place, we were so dumb not to double check if everything was OK and working well as we trusted very well, til after a week of stay that we began noticing the clogging commode, leaking pipes, broken sink that we repaired and paid for from our own pockets in the last four years. We left the sink OK and working well, but obviously, she will create stories to not return our money. I am not the only one complaining about this, and there are other reviews about her to attest this.

I read about Manila’s seafood market called Dampa and knew I just had to pay a visit.  It is a wonderful display of just about any seafood possible bordered by multiple restaurants waiting to cook it for you.  Everything is ultra fresh, most of it is still alive.  The procedure is you first choose your seafood from any of the numerous wet stalls and then choose which restaurant you want to cook it for you.  You really can’t get fresher than this set up.  This would be a must visit for any seafood lover visiting Manila.  Anthony Bourdain paid a visit here to try the freshest seafood in the Philippines.  Even if you’re not a seafood lover and don’t intend to dine here it is still a very interesting place to visit with many great photographic opportunities.  Most of the vendors are extremely proud of their displays and welcome photos.  ",Steven T,"Seaside Dampa is a large fish market where you can buy your seafood and have them cook (for a fee) at adjacent restaurants. Seafood is absolutely fresh, but also comes very expensive so be prepared to spend at least USD 40-60 per person, much more if you chose pricey items like lobsters or sea mantis.",ochassot,"Cravings were satisfied but got shocked as our pockets got empty!We did not go to the market and buy our own, we asked them to do it for us. A whopping Php 2,500 for two persons. No doubt they served good food, we had a kilo of crab, half kilo of shrimp and clams for soup.Though they were plenty -- I still find it pricey! The ambience also has to be improved so they can attract more customers.",Marifi M,"Food is good  that is our 2nd time, carefull lang kau sa pag order becoz sa menu nila akala mo cheap yong mga price kc ang nakasulat lang doon yong price ng service charge ng paluto kaya you must ask the waiter para hindi ka magulat sa bills mo",Bhang,"The food is great, but this place was so Expensive. We bought seafood outside the restaurants. We are super  suprise when we knew the price. Oh my God, we buy worth 2800 seafood and we pay 800 for the cooking. We are only 3 who will eat that foodCrabs: 1400 per kiloSquid: 1200 per kiloShrimp:1300 per kiloAnd we buy fish I forgot the name worth 500 per kilo. P.s: that is not yet cooked",Joy Lirazan,Food looks good but please beware of so many unscrupulous restaurants there (which are mostly owned by mainland China men operating business in the area). Menue price is for cooking charge but their actual price of meat / seafood are quite exorbitant. Ambiance is mostly targeted towards Chinese foreigners who frequent the area and cost is no object to them.,yujioka,"We came here expecting to have a good and fresh seafood feast. We went to a place that appears to be a Chinese restaurant but the owner/in charge was not involved with the customers at all. Only the locals(wait staff) where talking to us, promising us 1kg per dish (we didn’t havetime to buy it ourselves as we were already really hungry—because traffic!) with 350php cooking fee per dish (a bit steep than usual but again, hungry). The dishes came and we dug in straight away, of course. Halfway our dinner, one of my friends mentioned that the crabs looked really “empty”, then we noticed the prawns that looked less than a kilo. The sizzling squid was the same. We asked for a breakdown of the bill and realised that they have charged us way more than the amount of food (based on weight). When questioned, that’s when their demeanour changed. They were defensive, changed their stories (700gm per dish apparently, and not 1kg as previously agreed) and threatened to call the cops. We challenged them to please make sure the police gets involved to clear things up. Of course, no police came. In the end, we had to go to the market to check the prices and we paid them according to that price (like they initially promised us) but only for 500gms, not per kilo (because clearly, it wasn't a kilo). The initial bill was almost 7,000Php but we only paid 5,000php after we calculated what we think is fair and just. No one wants to talk to us anymore (the wait staff left the premises and the Chines “owner” doesn’t seem to care) so we left the money on the table and left. So never again in that horrible, horrible place. That was an expensive lesson learned.On the lighter side, Dampa in Alabang is apparently the better one with clear prices and dishes delivered as expected. We will be trying it out next year, so fingers crossed, it will be a total opposite experience and we can’t wait! We’re not giving up on dampa, not yet. 😉",Eric Uy,"Had a great time browsing around the market stalls to check on the wide variety of seafood available. We bought our favorite crabs , live prawns , scallops, oysters & had them cooked at the Hongkong Restuarant.The garlic rice & vegetable from Restuarant was good & they have also done a good job of cooking the seafood.Enjoyed ourselves tremendously digging in to those fresh seafoodSH",LiaLia,"if you are into seafood and grilled meals, then seaside dampa is a heaven's treat for you. there are lots of restos within the site and you will find the best ""paluto"" amongst them. try al so their garlic butter shrimps, chilly crabs and grilled liempos. you have to do the marketing first at the palengke within the grounds. try to haggle for the best prices, and avail of their discounts for paluto service. most restos offer beer and other liquor stuff.",Siew Hoon S,"It was my 4th visit in Trinity Restaurant in Dampa Macapagal. The previous 3 visits were ok that's why it became a fave restaurant for me. But Last night, was TERRIBLE! I bought 1 1/2 kgs of squid, 1 1/2 kgs of tahong /mussels .I know the QUANTITY of what I bought when it gets cooked. BUT when the waiter served our food, It was NOT AS EXPECTED, our squid in oyster sauce cut in small pieces was just 1 plate. steamed oysters and baked tahong  were just a few pieces  on 2 plates and when I asked the waiter about it he just said ""yan na yun"" !!!!!!! they LESSENED (BINAWASAN) THE QUANTITY OF FOOD I bought to be cooked. Well that is what I call another form of stealing. DO NOT EAT IN THIS RESTAURANT . if you do not want your food lessened when it gets served to you. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!",anythingpinoy,"Dampa or shanty is located near Manila bay seaside with a fresh seafood market and restaurants who will cook the seafood you purchase from the market.  After picking your choice of restaurant and type of recipe they cook the food and served at your table. JThe food is so fresh and sweet and we chose traditional Filipino recipes such as fresh lato (seaweed), sinigang na isda sa miso, adobong pusit was so tasty, steamed alimango (crab). And the best part is that the prices are reasonableI. Make sure you haggle when buying your seafood.  Oh an grab a fresh coconut and enjoy the coconut water as well. ",Toni,"After my 3 weeks USA vacation, it is time to feast with seafood favorites at Aling Tonyas.We bought the ingredients from the nearby seafood Market and brought these for cooking at Aling Tonyas.After the meal and endless burping, you can say that you have satisfied the cravings. ",Glenn Dabatos,"This is the place to be for fresh and tasty seafood. You walk the market and pick what seafood you want, make sure you check the prices per kilo as they really vary per stall. Once you have what you want you pick the restaurant to cook it again check the prices before you decide. We went to the super wok ( about half way down the lane way) as it was really busy and a great price. I dont think you can go wrong with a restaurant filled with locals. We got our prawns cooked in garlic butter and our crab in chilli. A must eat is the garlic rice.   ",Michael San Diego,"If you want great seafood, this place is where you wanna be. Pricy but you’ll love their sweet chili crab and buttered prawns. It was amazing! We loved it ❤️",nicknox83,"This is what you do to get the most out of this place.....specially the tourists...tip 1)  Buy your seafood inside the market first...just ask for the best price..don't be intimidated...there are stalls alongside the road but there are more stalls in the back..probably with better prices..2) pick your restaurant...in my experience the best restaurants in that area are the big ones in the corner...the big chinese restaurants...if you don't like to go to the market or you are pressed for time you can just order from their menus...but their prices are probably double vs buying your own supply...3)when i go there i just usually buy crab and shrimp and maybe fish or scallop...i then have it cooked maybe butter garlic...sweet chili sauce...or salted fish style...it used to cost 300 per kilo for the salted fish style... i then order the rice, drinks and the soup from the restaurant itself...the last time i went we spent about 3000 for two people...4) do not go with the people there trying to get customers...the big restaurants usually do not have to do this...although if you're always there you can try the smaller ones..since they probably charge less...these are the ones patronized by the local customers who do not want any fancy cooking...5) the cooking price is by kilos...usually a minimum of one kilo...if you don't want seafood there are also meat and poultry at the market in the back...as well as vegetables..but this place specializes in seafood so there might be less options for meat and vegetables...",May V

As the other reviews mention, the various halls play host to many small makeshift stores selling everything from fake Guccis and Rolexes to real and knock off phones and computers and their repair. Each time I go there, I spend more time looking to find the place I want to go since all these cubicle shops look alike.  I get the feeling there are probably a dozen good repair shops and all the rest serve as middle men doing minor repairs but they serves as middlemen if you need real repairs on you phone or computer.  Also you should expect a little “Puti Tax” since these shops will vary their prices if you look like a foreigner.  Nonetheless, the expansive area can probably offer just about anything you need.

As you walk through, you can see which ones offer better quality products. I have been to the shop called AJ-Nor twice and each time the pearls are good stuff.

Green Hills has fashion, accessory, toys and packed food items that are perfect to take home by tourists who like the Filipino snacks or returning Filipino nationals who loves to bring back a taste of home. There’s also an array of food choices in the surrounds. There’s a play zone to leave young kids so they can have fun while parents shop without feeling guilty.

In every floor and section of the museum, you’ll find different kinds of ecosystems where those species thrive. There was also a life-size model of Lolong, probably the world’s largest saltwater crocodile that has ever lived or captured. There were few people when I visited and the building was spacious and had a cozy atmosphere. If you’re interested about species in the Philippines, it’s a great place to visit.  Some people mixes up this museum with the other museums. This museum is for appreciation of the different species and ecosystems in the Philippines.

One of the main attraction is the “Tree of Life”, a gigantic atrium from floor to ceiling. Entrance fee is free and opens every Tuesdays to Sundays from 10 AM to 5 PM.",DinagyangSaIloilo,"the building renovation was great. and the way the building was designed made it easy to visit each of the exhibit.  i liked the layout very much.  that being said, the elevators were mostly out of order so you had to really be peripatetic the entire time. exhibits were well presented with a wealth of information to read. made up for some of the ""made up"" items on exhibit.  still, a great place to visit.",Son Yap N,Brought my students here and they liked it.

We adults found it excellent but its good for kids too, with many interactive areas.",Joseph V,"The building featured the centerpiece “The Tree of Life”. The architecture is really impressive as it is reflective of the rich natural resources of the country. Each floor gives a sophisticated look with its interactive exhibits.

The restoration and use is good. The museum had very good collection of the exhibits.,foodcrawlph,"Our short trip was overall good however one of the staff was VERY RUDE. I took a video (which I thought was ok, I'm sorry) when we were about to leave, and this lady guard came at us with a very rude tone. It was an honest mistake, deleted the video & said sorry but she keeps on babbing. I thought maybe if it were a family or a parent, she would have act more polite. Please re-evaluate your staffs & teach them to be nice! Thank you!",Jitendra Singh

Very fun to watch and perfect for a couple or family or even solo.,esco0230,"For long time Manila residents this is still Luneta!  The children and families have taken this park back.  A lot less hawkers and a much cleaner well cared and manicured park for all to enjoy.  You can spend a quiet afternoon without being bothered to buy something or read something.  A real park to enjoy!On some nights, you get a light music and water show for all ages.  Some family oriented vendors have a place  to sell their wares, not scattered across walkways blocking busy routes.   It's has changed to a very family oriented place to rest or exercise for those who shun the hot day.There are great plans to expand the park all the way to Manila Bay.  What a place it would be to wave the big Philippine Flag right on the shore!  Come on Manila it can be done!What a beautiful place to be after all these years!!!",texasaero,Another good value place to go and see if you are like me and love the cultural aspect of the Filipinos then you will really enjoy being here,Hammer13,"Be sure to visit this park when you're in Manila, Rizal is also the National Hero of the Philippines.",Christopher W,"Having learned that my hotel is only 2 blocks away from this Park, I  rushed to it after my check-in.There are many things to see and do here: statue of Dr Jose Rizal, his actual assassination site, big pond, statues of local heroes, Chinese Garden, open auditorium, Bulova Clock, Grand Stand, etcHighly recommended to vis ",LolaGo1,"Metro Manila lacks public parks. This is one of the few large parks where you can leisurely relax and stroll in Manila. I hope there would be more public parks within Metro Manila, or the unused portions of the roofs of large shopping be converted into rooftop parks. ",Makoto,"too many people at night, seems all people gathered here. .i try some streets foods here. . and have some little playmates around, , people are friendly,",Alan S,"The park named after the national hero, writer, artist and political activist, is hugely popular. In addition, it has a theatre where different groups perform free of charge.

Lots of families and people enjoying the park and especially the fountains that are lit up and dance to music ,Las Buganvillas,"I had read it's like Central Park but then in Manila. But it's far from that. Maybe they say because it's well known in Manila but to me just a moderate park, not very special. I like the parks in Intramuros way more.",Bernadine S,"gosh, considering it is a national treasure, why is it so tacky and not maintained?  Guess there is no money for that.",Willeke A,"It is a nice park in the morning, until probably 10 am. Then it becomes super crowded and stays like that during the day. There are a lot of people who try to sell you stuff, including buggy rides to the intramuros. Tell them no, because intramuros is definitely walkable and don't fall for their tricks. Just smile and say no thank you. Probably avoid at night, I mean it's full of beggars even in the day so I can really not imagine what occurs there at nighttime. I went to the Natural history museum there, it is definitely worth it! Not counting churches, its the cleanest place in Manila (the museum, not the park) :)",J Mesinger,We visited this park after early evening. Alot of families with children were around so its a great way to spend time for them!,Hana,We ended up in this park after visit the museum of anthropology and the museum of natural history.

The show outside with the seals and birds was funny and exciting. I enjoyed the jelly fish and the aquarium you walk through. I enjoyed many of the exhibits. On the downside it is a very disorganized place and it is not the cleanest place I have ever visited. The staff were all very friendly. The price for admittance was reasonable. I was continually unaware how to get to the next exhibit. However there were many very great exhibits and the live show was well worth visiting Ocean Park if you get to Manila. Take a hat or umbrella as the outdoor show can be very warm on a normal sunny day in beautiful Manila. Salamat to the staff.,Sarge57,If you love fish and animals thus is the Best Place to be as they have quite a variety from sea lion shows to different kind of fishes and birds. They have packages which are not really cheap but the value is quite good. Kids and kids at heart will probably enjoy it more than adults.

Definitely try to do the online deals and you will save money and get through the line much faster. Pay attention to the show times so you dont miss anything - save the ones open later for last. The Fish Spa was fun - but not if your feet are ticklish.,BrettJB,"Antarctica exhibit allows an up-close feed the penguins in their exhibit habitat, none other aquarium in the States have it. That was a surprise and delight especially with a 3 year old grandson. Overall, the place could use updated design and new lightning setup. The cost entrance is cheap in standard, but you are not expecting much in return. It does provide little ones space to run and enjoyment.

I cannot list everyone, but you have a lot of good choice.",patli2015,"An over crowded mall with inadequate parking, poor maintenance of toilets and sometimes areas that are hazardous to people. We decided to spend Labor Day in ATC to enjoy some good food at one particular restaurant we frequently dine at, shopping and probably a movie. To our disappointment, there was no air conditioning, toilets were closed and no water for hand washing at the least. The gruelling heat which affected both clients and ales people made it impossible to enjoy the day. And the thought of utensils and and dishes not being properly prepared and cleaned finally lead us to the exit. On our way out, we noticed a plastic with metal piece of an escalator we used jotting out which could have easily injured anyone if they hadn't seen this...or more so blind a child as it was waist high. We have been living in the area for almost 25 years now, and we have seen the mediocre improvements done on ATC. The management seems to be more keen on earning rent from its tenants than providing safety and convenience for the people who patronise this mall.",RyokoDoc,"The halls are narrow making it feel cramped. The mall is generally dark despite it having a courtyard- maybe it was the low ceilings?  The layout does not make any sense (the cinema is on the first floor with its lobby used as a passageway for one part of the mall to another- cinemas are usually on higher floors and at the corner so there is less noise). Security seemed to be an issue since there were beggars inside the mall. It was generally dingy as in poorly maintained and required cleaning. Maybe I’m used to clean, well-lit, spacious malls or maybe I thought ATC would have the same feel as the hotels, clubs, and homes I’ve seen in the area, whatever it was, ATC fell short of my expectations.",Kat9384,Needs an update or atleast an upkeep.Town Centers are figuratively where everyone goes.

Prices vary depending on your choice and taste. There are also lots of luxury stores and boutiques both international and local brands.

There are also spas, game zones, health clinic, barber shop, two supermarkets and department stores. Parking lots are also plenty. Place is also very secured and with security guards before you enter and roving guards.
