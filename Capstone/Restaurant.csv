Cosmic,"5057 P. Burgos Cor. General Luna Brgy. Poblacion 2/f, Makati, Luzon 1210 Philippines",‚Ç±80 - ‚Ç±350,"Filipino, Asian, Fusion",5.0,"My friend and i are on a quest to visit vegan friendly restaurants in the Philippines. Cosmic in Poblacion is our 3rd resto that we've visited this year. 4 tastefully crafted yet affortable dishes were served on our table. The serving is supposedly for one...person only but it could be finished by two. The pasta salad and spinach lasagna (not in photo) are very filling and tasty, enoki tempura is very crunchy and delicious, sisig could be mistaken as the non-vegan version. Need to mention are the house made tea with calamansi and ginger cocktail. Staff Joy is very accommodating and very helpful too. Cosmic is very worthy vegan resto to come back to and we will definitely do it (once we've finished our listüòä).More"
Hummus Elijah,"7850 Makati Avenue Next To Starbucks And Wendy's. Near Berjaya Hotel and I'm Hotel., Makati, Luzon 1209 Philippines",‚Ç±250 - ‚Ç±400,"Lebanese, Mediterranean, Healthy, Middle Eastern",4.5,"The resto has seen better days, it seems a bit run down,  needs some repair, perhaps due to the pandemic, there are financial strains on maintenance. The pictures on the walls show there has been a deep understanding of Lebanese cuisine and the way to...present and serve meals. Not much is left. Also the original charm of the room is nearly lost, only the pictures and reviews from newspapers and magazines conjure up an atmosphere that you can hardly see and feel anymore. What is still outstanding is the variety of oriental spices and ingredients in the shelves which are displayed as in a store and which you can buy there or order through Lazada. We ordered and tried almost everything from the menu, the falafel was cold as if taken from a freezer, the salad was good, especially the tomatoes in it, which is rare in Manila. The hummus was fresh, they use high-quality olive oil on top, The Turkish coffee was strong and aromatic. The cutlery and plates were very simple and did not match the pictures on the website. Prices were very fair, much lower than in BGC. Service charge is included. There is no parking in front of it so you must leave your car in the Century City Mall for 50 pesos and walk the 200 meters to the resto.More"

Samba,"30th 5th Avenue Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City, Luzon 1630 Philippines",‚Ç±591 - ‚Ç±985,"Peruvian, Latin, Seafood, Healthy, Grill",5.0,"We came here for my husband bday dinner, the food was good and the price is normal for 5 star hotel. But we were disappointed with the service, how they answered our requests was not like a 5 star hotel service compared with other restaurants...for 5 star hotel service this place service is too poor. We will not recommend this place for special dinner they really not accommodate for that.More"

Falafel Yo,"Legazpi Street 4th Floor, Greenbelt 3 Cinema, Makati, Luzon Philippines",‚Ç±49 - ‚Ç±369,"Fast Food, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Israeli",5.0,"Simplicity at it's best. No frills, no gigantic confusing menu and no complicated add-on. And yet deliver something so bloody good, is only a living proof that if you got the one thing right in restaurant industry you are there to rule, which is Good...food. Falafel yo is like my second kitchen. With just three dishes in menu ,and each heavenly tasty they have not only managed a regular patronage but also newcomers don't hesitate to try it out , given that it is vegetarian place in a meat loving nation. Kudos to the team who run it and kudos to the original recipe. The bun is perfectly soft , falafel balls are to die for and the whole combo of salads, sauces and hummus in it makes a giant meal in itself. It's my default dinner when I'm in no mood to hit the kitchen. Price wise, just right. I hope they still continue to offer it unless something crazy happens around the world. Absolute favourite and authentic. Must try.More"

NOT A GOOD TIME TO GO SINCE THEY DO CLOSE AT 2:30PM FOR THEIR DINNER HOUR PREPS. All the LEFTOVER food was OLD FAST!! Didn't bother to cook anymore than what was already out there in...their catering containers. Since we're still in a pandemic, they will serve you the portions of the food that are in these containers. WORST BUFFET AND WORST BIRTHDAY EXPERIENCE EVER!!! 1 rating for the FOOD, plus 1 additional for the interior deco and view of Manila Bay as you meander thru their measly food line.More"
Inagiku,"Ayala Avenue corner Makati Avenue, Makati, Luzon 1219 Philippines","‚Ç±1,969 - ‚Ç±2,954","Japanese, Sushi, Asian",4.0,"I didn‚Äôt like the way they treated us. It was my birthday and they knew about it and they didn‚Äôt even do anything just so their customer would be pleased. Nada. For an expensive restaurant like this somehow you go beyond so customers are satisfied....Disappointed that there was no extra effort. 

I love the food to be fair and the beef that we ordered is so bloody expensive but worth it. See, I paid so much but was not satisfied with your service. Unlike at Samba, we were treated like royalty but here in Inagiku the crew were just snooty. 

Overall, I don‚Äôt like the vibe at Makati Shangrila. I will not go back there. I frequent Edsa Shangrila and Shangrila at the Fort. They‚Äôre way better.More"

Rizal Street Habana Compound, Davao City, Mindanao 8000 Philippines","‚Ç±394 - ‚Ç±2,462","European, Asian",4.5,We went there on a Friday under a reservation. It's cozy since it's in the back portion of a compound. The owner would visit his guest/s in every table and engaged them in small talks. The staff were accommodating too. Starters are served since it...takes a while for the main courses to be served. Food there taste great most esp the seafood pasta and the apple strudel. Prices are highly affordable as well.More

Our 1st time experience being here was last Sept 5 2019 with my husband. They serve different menu using veggies thats why its called vegan.
