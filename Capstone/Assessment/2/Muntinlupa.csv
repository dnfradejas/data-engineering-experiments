 Muntinlupa,Hotel,"Azumi Boutique Hotel, Alabang Muntinlupa","Stylish and environmentally friendly, Azumi Boutique Hotel in Alabang provides the modern traveler a quality hotel at an outstanding value. Azumi's 186 rooms are characterized by use of earth tones with a distinct pop of orange, wood laminate floors and floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors create a feeling of open space and also allow one to appreciate the cityscape. The roof deck is a sensory escape with its 360 degree view of the Alabang Skyline while enjoying a dip in the infinity lap pool or a drink by the lounge beds.

Their 24/7 front desk was always there anwering my questions and provided excellent services. Especially at night or early morning since im a night owl, i could always depend on their front desk to accommodate any request wether its more towels or an extra blanket and even provided me a small basin to dip my feet in because i had aching feet. They even took the time to call you and make sure you were comfortable and  Have everything you need. They are always present ready to at any time of the day. Not to mention the selection of food restaurants around the hotel, thers always something open even at 3:00am because of the Hotels location. Also i would like to highlight Jo An, their night shift guest service employee",TJ,Their service was great for my grandmother‚Äôs quarantine duration. They provided airport pickup and contact with the chef for her renal diet. Front Desk was very helpful with our questions and concerns as well.,denpanganiban,"Had a wonderful stay at Azumi. Frontdesk is very helpful always specially on getting my certificate. Food is also superb, i miss the Filipino dishes which they also served, it is all delicious. Since I am on quarantine, they delivered it on the chair outside my door and it felt safe as it is in a sealed container. The room is clean and spacious. Would like to be back after pandemic.",ZenC,"This is where I spent my 14-day quarantine upon arrival from USA. The room was clean and spacious, had fast wifi connection, and staying at this location had an advantage for ordering food on apps like foodpanda/ grabfood/ lalafood because of nearby restaurants in Alabang! The staff were also very friendly and accommodating since day 1 until I checked out. Their staff wore PPE suits as they deliver food in front of the rooms of guests who were in quarantine.   would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a staycation or for quarantine purposes!",Nath B,"A pleasant surprise that will make your six day stay inside a room comfortable and reassuring. Reliable internet connection allowed me to work nonstop for a couple of hours/ day. Totally refreshed the morning after. I was impressed by the staff who went the  extra mile to ensure my stay was stress free. The super friendly hotel staff headed by Jill Realeza immediately responded to all my needs, linen/toiletry  change, trash issues, food scheduling...reassuring health measures with a Clean Stay approach, superb window view,.capped a great quarantine stay. Although food meals may need some improvement,  I would still recommend staying there anytime you have business or just figuring out where to spend your nights in the southern part of Manila.",SkyDoc,I needed a quiet place with stable internet connection for my online oral examination and Azumi Hotel has delivered beyond expectations. My exam lasted for 6 hours and I did not experience any lag with their internet. The hotel is also strategically located where in restos and even a shopping mall is within your reach. PLUS! I passed my exam so kudos to the staff of Azumi. I felt safe during my 2-day stay with this hotel. Did I mention they even have the most beautiful sky line view of the south? I'm definitely coming back when this pandemic ends.,TJG,"Had a pleasant stay with Azumi for 2 nights. My wifi worked well, the staff were very nice and helpful, they extended all the help they can without hesitation. I look forward coming back, hopefully after pandemic.",MBernardino,"Was checked out yesterday from January 2,after waiting our swabtest result and it was worth to stay, the room, bathroom everything was clean,hope to be back one day with my fianc√© this is really a highly recommended hotel.anyway I was in room 514",Janne12177,"The Hotel is located close to a busy street. Inside it‚Äòs modern and nice. The reception and hotel staff is helpful and friendly. Even in Quarantine it‚Äòs ok to stay. The full service  for quarantine guests(break fast , lunch , dinner) is not recommendable for westerners. In this case better use the service from foodpanda or other services. The room is big enough as well as the bath room. It‚Äòs clean and good equipped.",Ryder67,"Last week, I stayed in Azumi Boutique Hotel for three days.  It was a great stay.  Not only was the room beautiful, filled with thoughtful and useful amenities (mulitple tv cable channels, microwave, refrigerator, etc), but the staff also did their best to make everyone feel welcome and secure.  Thank you, Azumi! We will definitely be back for a longer stay.",FSY,"Stayed in Azumi last month, and I can say it‚Äôs a great service. The front and back  of the house did a good for the guest needs. The room is clean and the staff are very accommodating thank you and Good job !",Melissa S,"This is one of the few hotels that accepts bookings (on business not leisure) while on GCQ. Check in was smooth and easy. Got my key card and room number in less than 10minutes. You get 1 complimentary parking ticket per room. The on building parking is limited and is on a 1st come 1st serve basis. They have a steel parking outside available. Reception area is neat they have comfi chairs around with a chic design. Room is spacious enough for 2 and can actually fit 3 comfortably as they have 1 big sofa that can be used as a bed.aircondition is new and freezing so i like that a lot. You get 2 free bottled water after you check in, tooth brush, soap and shampoo are also there. The room has a decent ref and a microwave. They dont have a kettle though, we had to request for it. And",Macky M,"I very disappointed about this hotel, this  Hotel not allow me to bring my visitors and immediate inform me cant bring any visitors. Totally is Stupid mind set. frontdesk service is rude not welcome and friendly. Also the security not well too...",Soon Toro,"Hotel is relatively new thus facade is still at it‚Äôs finest. I like the chic lobby, comfortable room and the overviewing infinity pool. Food is also tasty. üëç Near Molito and ATC so if you need to unwind or need anything else you just need to cross the street and everything is there. Great staycation place just right smack in the city.",Basille A,"Our room's view is overlooking the Alabang skyline, what a great view especially at night! Cozy and clean room, comfortable and soft pillows and mattress, nice bathroom. The pool is perfectly located at the penthouse area and perfect for relaxing. Definitely will recommend for family weekend or gatherings. Romulo's Cafe at the ground floor also offers delectable food you will surely enjoy. Friendly and accommodating staff is a plus.

 Muntinlupa,Tourist Site,Alabang Town Center,No Data,Shopping Malls,"Alabang Town Center, Muntinlupa City, 1780",0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Alabang Town Center has a very clean and nice family lounge where my wife can breastfeed my baby. Chairs are even Lazyboy chairs. While waiting, I can rest on the ample sofa available. Free access for ARC cardholders or those with BPI Amore card. ",Jed,Not much of a shopper unless my wife tells me to go with her. This place has a nice feel to it. Plenty of things to look at and check out. We had no issue with parking which is a plus. Here from out of town and came in to pick up a few items.,yay83,"A lot of things are available at Alabang Town Center. Shops, super markets, restaurants, cinemas, sport shops,  medical clinics. I cannot list everyone, but you have a lot of good choice.",patli2015,"An over crowded mall with inadequate parking, poor maintenance of toilets and sometimes areas that are hazardous to people. We decided to spend Labor Day in ATC to enjoy some good food at one particular restaurant we frequently dine at, shopping and probably a movie. To our disappointment, there was no air conditioning, toilets were closed and no water for hand washing at the least. The gruelling heat which affected both clients and ales people made it impossible to enjoy the day. And the thought of utensils and and dishes not being properly prepared and cleaned finally lead us to the exit. On our way out, we noticed a plastic with metal piece of an escalator we used jotting out which could have easily injured anyone if they hadn't seen this...or more so blind a child as it was waist high. We have been living in the area for almost 25 years now, and we have seen the mediocre improvements done on ATC. The management seems to be more keen on earning rent from its tenants than providing safety and convenience for the people who patronise this mall.",RyokoDoc,"The halls are narrow making it feel cramped. The mall is generally dark despite it having a courtyard- maybe it was the low ceilings?  The layout does not make any sense (the cinema is on the first floor with its lobby used as a passageway for one part of the mall to another- cinemas are usually on higher floors and at the corner so there is less noise). Security seemed to be an issue since there were beggars inside the mall. It was generally dingy as in poorly maintained and required cleaning. Maybe I‚Äôm used to clean, well-lit, spacious malls or maybe I thought ATC would have the same feel as the hotels, clubs, and homes I‚Äôve seen in the area, whatever it was, ATC fell short of my expectations.",Kat9384,Needs an update or atleast an upkeep.Town Centers are figuratively where everyone goes. This is a place where everyone meets from richest to the poorest..from the Honest to the most dishonest..ok how about this..dont update it don't upkeep it.. But the least that you can do is clean it up properly!!,T Q,"You could find here variety of Restaurants with different types of Cuisines, some are international brands while some are local but still of high quality and standard. Prices vary depending on your choice and taste. There are also lots of luxury stores and boutiques both international and local brands. The place is wide enough not to be lost because everything are clustered together. This place is truly a nice place to hang out and spend your time with family and friends. There are also spas, game zones, health clinic, barber shop, two supermarkets and department stores. Parking lots are also plenty. Place is also very secured and with security guards before you enter and roving guards. There is also a nearby church, the St. Jerome  Church.",tequilaalloy_15,"It‚Äôs been a while when Alabang is just a scary, old place. Now you could see that the place is developing, really fast!",vgal0579,Has been around for over 2 decades and has seen better days. Well guarded and has free parking for senior citizens and handicapped.,C R,"The best mall in the south for me! I love the chill environment, and the selection of restaurants, shopping boutiques, and leisure activities. There's always a place for everyone in ATC, young or old. Kids can play around in the park at the town plaza, adults can stay at CBTL to watch their kids play or to have a chit chat. You have 2 grocery store options Makati Supermarket and Metro Gaisano. Honestly you've got everything at ATC!",Christy Q,"Interested in formidable comfort for seniors and for families? Unsure of what shape or size your intended purchases are? Interested in cuisine for all ages, from the nostalgic 1950s to the NOW times? Interested in leisure and entertainment in their most delightful modes and variety?Try Alabang Town Center! It is a Town ... it is a Center ... it is Alabang for people of all social levels!",Angie W,"Alabang town center is the best place to be in the south. Many things to offer from eating to specialty shopping places... cafes, tiendas etc... excel to place... the cinemas are tops offering them latest and they adjust to what‚Äôs popular by increasing the number of cinemas showing top movies at the time... parking can be tough though during weekends... A great place to bring your family teens and little ones alike!",antoniotorralba,Alabang Town Center Christmas Decor is beautiful & an awesome weekend fireworks display adds festive feelings to Mall goers.,GeneS,"Me and my workmates went out for dinner and we decided to look for a good place to eat here in ATC. The place is really nice and very organized, I would definitely recommend this for a family bonding, friends and couples. Shakeys all the way!",8enjie62,I have visited this this place just earlier and was very amazed with the new design for the Christmas season. We ate at elegant restaurants inside the mall and see different people room around the premise enjoying the cold place.,SniperGhost,good value for shopping and nice place to be ; big enough without being huge ; some restaurants nearby,DavePHMNL,"A 30-year old institution which needs to re-invent itself - tight corridors, noisy, poor clustering of stores, difficult parking, but ...... good location, practical array of goods & commodities, nice architectural design.",chrislea224,Staff were very friendly and prompt to give service. Food was good as well. It was a busy Sunday for them but even then we were very happy with our experience.,Leandro J,"A typical Ayala mall - looks quite luxurious but quite affordable. The landscape is great with many food shoppes and boutiques. Food is not also too expensive. A good place to kill time while waiting for your appointment in DFA which is nearby. Also, it's just a 5 min (light traffic) jeep ride to and from starmall or from south station which makes this mall an excellent stop over for weary travel-goers.",Numjuan,"If you are coming for work or business to this side of Manila, Alabang, you must visit Alabang Town Center, is an outdoors type of mall, reminds me of the US outlets, very beautiful place, full of great stores and brands that you will be very familiar with, offers a great variety of restaurants and the most important thing to me was that it wasnt crowded as the festival, this is heaven compared to the Festival mall definitely come to the Alabang town center",HeyyoRenRen
