PROS: - near SM megamall / podium (chose this hotel as I am attending a wedding on that day in Podium). That's it.  CONS: - greeted by a cockroach in the room - smelly / dark hallways and parking lots - no mats in the room - poorly maintained rooms (expectation vs reality, see website photos) - staff responding on my FB queries don't seem to think and understand my queries first before replying. I had to repeat my queries for them to get my question (i know you are responding based from the format given to you - this is not the automatic reply - but its a case to case basis, understand the question first).  Tip: perfect place if you are not staying inside the hotel the whole day. Surprised that this is a 3 star hotel. Ayway,",Tatandra,"I totally not recommending this hotel!! This hotel management will charge you absolutely ridiculously amount for something that they will justify by saying you violate the rules and regulation. Even a very small dirt, hotel managers are too arrogant too. This actually happen last January 2020 but because of some important matter to attend to during that time plus this pandemic I wasn't able to post this review right away but everytime I remember what happen to us that night, it really getting into my nerves and cant accept that they were able to get that money from me that easy. Here's what happen  I booked one of their rooms last January for a small gathering, I'm with my friends and nephew who is 3 years old along with other 2 kids who is 8 and 10 years old, we don't have any",reina,Was in Manila for 3 weeks stayed at BSA Twin Towers. Perfect location between SM Mega Mall and Podium. Our room was on 51st floor and we loved the big windows and exellent view looking over golf course and crazy Manila traffic. I would recommend this place and will stay here again.,Warren N,Location is very strategic; it is in the center of business areas and malls are just few steps away. You will have lots and lots of restaurants to choose from. Public transportation is readily available; very accessible,Dori Gee,"Near the major malls and business district, convenient for shopping and leisure, recommended for long-time business travelers,  However, the TV in my bedroom is not working. I used to watch at the living room.",Pia A,"Duration of Stay- 2 nights, 3 days  Pros: Great Location Clean Washroom Spacious  Cons: Cockroaches Parking fee exclusive (there's no enough parking spaces too) Uncomfortable Bed Not so clean Bedroom  I am an event organizer of a company and an average traveller, that's why I know what to expect in a low cost, average cost, high cost hotels/ condotels.  I had high expectation of the condotel (now they claim as a hotel) because the cost is higher than the low cost budget hotel I had been staying (1-2kms away from BSA), so I considered changing hotel due to the great location of BSA (nevermind the additional cost I had to pay).  Well, upon check in I had to wait for the long qeue. Check in and parking. Long qeue in the elevator. (4 elevators only 1 or 2 are working). Btw, parking",ResTravels,We stayed there for two nights and I saw cockroaches. The experience is great although cleanliness is a big factor for me so I think they need to work on that. The reception has a long quee and we cannot check out early or check in early. Over all it needs lots of improvement.,travelbud.net,"The best location and rooms are spacious. I stayed here whenever I come to the Philippines. Staff were very approachable and friendly, they all make you feel welcomed. I highly recommend this place ❤️❤️❤️",Ems mcl,"Booked for three nights & noticed the following day that housekeeping did not throw all garbage. They made up beds & changed towels but empties, used kitchen utensils, cups & plates were neither dished out nor cleaned up. I would say their housekeeping staff needs a little follow up.",julia o,"We avail of the Two Bedroom Suite for overnight stay.  Pros:  1. The room is okay and spaceous enough for overnight stay of 5. 2. Food choices for breakfast buffet is few but delicious. 3. The Two bedroom Suite has 1 master bedroom with a twin size (I guess) bed, with aircon at television. The 2nd room only has 1 single bed. There is another room which is the made's room, with single bed and bathroom inside the room. 4. Has 4 chair dining area 5. Has kitchen and refrigerator 6. Has sofa and television 7. Has free wifi  CONS:  1. I booked directly to BSA TWIN TOWER online reservation, and book an overnight stay on the said room with complimentary breakfast for 4 adults. By thew children aged 7 above are considered adult so they are not free in complimentary breakfast. During",chinaeyez20,"Great ambiance of room, spacious but affordable. The view outside of the hotel was awesome since our room was at the 24th floor. The pool was clean and relaxing. And the no limit number of guest and no corkage fee policy tops it all. Indeed, we had an amazing stay. ❤️",Kaye,"I was very lucky to get an instant confirmation on the 31st of December. We were booked out by 1 hotel so I had to quickly check another accommodation. No, I won't accept a new year's eve on the street with my 3 kids. Got surprised with the number of guests I saw upon check-in. Despite of the big crowd, we were able to check-in with ease. Kudos to frontdesk team for being professional and accommodating! The room is big and very comfortable. My kids enjoyed the pool and their breakfast although the variety  was not that much. The location is perfect! Since I only had 5 days to stay, we were close to the mall and areas which I needed to visit.  Cost is a bit high than others but the location will really give you a lot of savings. The only issue I encountered is for the room",Madz Mendez,"I booked the hotel without looking at reviews. I only read reviews here a few hours before the stay and was so worried. I'm a former hotelier and with a rate of just roughly over Php 2000 with free breakfast for 2, I wasn't really expecting so much.  Check-in was ok according to my husband who checked in ahead of me. There was a 2k deposit but we prepared for this. Anyway, I always expect hotels to have a security deposit in place. Goodie if there's none! The elevators are a bit slow so it's not for those who lack patience. But that's only during peak hours, like check-in and check out. We had to ride the elevator up then down because it keeps skipping our floor when going down. The building is old but our room was well-maintained and we had a wonderful view. It was big too. It",niezhining,"What I like about BSA Twin Towers is its location: just across SM Megamall, secondly, each room comes with coffee, water and appliances you'll need to heat up food and cool down drinks. Last, but certainly not the least, I love the rainshower head although the heater in B4705 was wonky; the hot water wasn't constant. It comes out hot then quickly cools off. I also love that the toilet has a bidet for thoroughly cleaning up yourself after pooping and the hotel provides you with dental hygiene kits, shampoo and conditioner. The bath towels were also soft and smelled good.   Breakfast at Cornerstone Cafe needs improvement on variety, taste and preparation. The scrambled egg on the chafing dish was too runny and bland. The ham and sausage on the menu the first time I stayed at BSA.",Dream566459,"If you are on a budget, think twice. You may want to stretch your budget a little and find somewhere else better than BSA.   Pros: - Location. Just across SM Megamall Bldg A entrance - Good view of the metropolis at the higher floors - It's a condotel, has a mini kitchen and dining table in the room - The room was clean and beddings were OK - Hotel staff and guards were courteous and attentive - Free breakfast, wifi, gym, swimming and playground use.  Cons: - Room was very bland and unappealing compared to advertised photos. Looks very basic like any motels in Manila - Room uses a window type aircon. Ours was a bit noisy and annoying but it's cold though. - Lobby and hotel corridors are hot as hell - Had to wait for the elevator for several minutes, either going up/down - No",Unico Roja,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data

After several months of not going to Megamall, my son and I finally decided to go there and ate at Frenchbaker. The place is cozy as always . And what I love with this place is that they sure know how to follow safety protocol. They put a glass divider in every table to ensure that their customers are safe. Kudos",shiela inocencio,I love this mall ever since I was a kid. Although one can get lost even though I frequently go here.,travelbud.net,I discovered the SM mall Makati enroute to Greenbelt mall from the Ayala MRT. This sophisticated mall has become one of my favourite hangouts then on. The mall is conviniently located in the exit of the Ayala MRT and offers a variety of shopping and restaurants.,Aaqarsh Aiyyar,"Being one of the biggest malls in the country, this mall has no vegan option. Very crowded as well..",AJ I,"It has shops, restaurants, fitness gyms (Slimmer's and Fitness First)  and supermarket that caters basically to all of our needs.  Definitely a must go destination.",mcf_lite@yahoo.com,"A day would probably be not enough for strolling within this shopping mall, which is one of the world’s largest. It can be a destination by itself, for those who want to experience the shopping malls in the Philippines. I would love to see more greenery or place to sit within the mall, similar to that of  the rooftop of SM Aura in BGC.",Makoto,"So many products to choose from at the right price, great discounts and good quality. Shop with ease.",christynad610,"A lovely place to dine in surrounded by DC Heroes, statues and quality made toys. The food is great, delicious and well presented name after your favorite heroes. The service is well attentive. Whoever have a chance to try this restaurant will always be young at heart.Small gift shop is also available on affordable price.",Johnny C,"You can find everything in SM Megamall. They have a department store, as well as independent shops. Shops range from low to mid end. Lots of food options as well. They also have activities like bowling, ice skating, iMax, archery, etc. ",Lenina,"We went there to eat, shop and have a walk. The huge size of the 2 buildings makes it a good way to shop and exercise at the same time. All you want to buy is here even medical clinic and high end stores. A good full day can be spent in this place.",Colleen O,This is one of the best mall in manila that I go with. A lot of things that you can do aside from shopping and eating.,Gene P,"compared to other supermarkets, this one in megamall building A was really not a good one. Aside from the fact that most items on our list are unavailable, out of 20+ (22 if i counted it right) counters, only 5 are open. Not sure if they are lacking in manpower as i saw some staff chatting inside the supermarket. Hoping they would improve. Megamall was our go to supermarket before Unimart 😅",Casey,The shopping in Antipolo is just great. Small Hypermarket and All Home has everything you need. Shop Wise is excellent for groceries and the SM Mall is fantastic to say the least. Everything you want is there at reasonable prices. Many restaurants as well and the food is just great.,AizeeMarie,"Great mall, if you can't find something in this mall your nuts as this place has EVERYTHING!! As a westerner not used to such a busy atmosphere it was a little overwhelming. After getting used to it I can't wait to go back again. ",Indy27,"I come to Megamall quite often as it is close to home and has most of the things I need at about a 10-15 minute walk away. Last visit was Jan. 10, 2019 (or yesterday as I am currently writing this). These are the major observations I've made:a.) When a lot of people come to Megamall to shop, you'll know as traffic becomes super congested and it is hard to get around even if the mall isn't exactly where you need to be. b.) Guards can be a little too pushy when they are inspecting bags to the point where one guard yanked my bag towards her just to poke the wooden stick they all hold into my bag. Guards have jobs to do but this doesn't give them the right to be that rude towards customers.c.) Most bathrooms often have one or two stalls that contain toilets which don't flush properly or don't contain enough toilet tissue.d.) Sales assistants in their department store do one of two things: Stand around talking to each other zoning out or hound their customers to get tags or codes off products or transaction numbers from receipts just so they can get commission that they don't deserve because they didn't actually do anything to be helpful. e.) With as many shops as Megamall has my boyfriend and I find that there are still some shops that Megamall does not have that we have seen in numerous other malls around the Metro. Some examples of stores we have searched for are: Digital Walker, Hobbes & Landes,  Baskin Robbins and Henry's Camera.Though there are many shops to go to and quite a few things to do here there is still a lot of room for improvement.",Ryan,"This shopping centre is a one stop shop that has everything to keep families entertained for hours. I have kids of different ages from a primary schooler to high schoolers. We can go our separate ways to indulge in our own interests to cover a lot more ground.I myself spent a few hours on the 5th level to do mani/pedi and have my hair treatment and blow waved.My primary aged daughter went to the arcade at the basement level with her dad. My two teenagers went around to shop and do ice skating.There’s a cinema, a grocery store , food halls/courts and  a variety of restaurants that will cater to your taste weather it is Italian, Japanese, French, Western fast food , Mexican or local Filipino cuisine. You can find every weather it is fashion, high end luxury brands, electronics and different services like hair salon, nail salon, brow bar, facials, massage, travel centre.",kikilala,"This Mall is Mega big. As it was in December the crowds were crazy , the traffic was crazy in and out of it ( by the way worst traffic in world in my opinion). The shops are plentiful there are just to many to choose from. Worth a visit but try and follow the signs to were you entered and probably need to exit as it you may get easily lost.",Johanna A,"this is one of the most awful malls ive been to. tremendous traffic, no parking, extremely rude guards and staff. one of the places NOT to go to or visit",Paddy
