No frills, no gigantic confusing menu and no complicated add-on. And yet deliver something so bloody good, is only a living proof that if you got the one thing right in restaurant industry you are there to rule, which is Good...food. Falafel yo is like my second kitchen. With just three dishes in menu ,and each heavenly tasty they have not only managed a regular patronage but also newcomers don't hesitate to try it out , given that it is vegetarian place in a meat loving nation. Kudos to the team who run it and kudos to the original recipe. The bun is perfectly soft , falafel balls are to die for and the whole combo of salads, sauces and hummus in it makes a giant meal in itself. It's my default dinner when I'm in no mood to hit the kitchen. Price wise, just right. I hope they still continue to offer it unless something crazy happens around the world. Absolute favourite and authentic. Must try.More"

The pictures on the walls show there has been a deep understanding of Lebanese cuisine and the way to...present and serve meals. Not much is left. Also the original charm of the room is nearly lost, only the pictures and reviews from newspapers and magazines conjure up an atmosphere that you can hardly see and feel anymore. What is still outstanding is the variety of oriental spices and ingredients in the shelves which are displayed as in a store and which you can buy there or order through Lazada. We ordered and tried almost everything from the menu, the falafel was cold as if taken from a freezer, the salad was good, especially the tomatoes in it, which is rare in Manila. The hummus was fresh, they use high-quality olive oil on top, The Turkish coffee was strong and aromatic. The cutlery and plates were very simple and did not match the pictures on the website. Prices were very fair, much lower than in BGC. Service charge is included. There is no parking in front of it so you must leave your car in the Century City Mall for 50 pesos and walk the 200 meters to the resto.More"

The pasta salad and spinach lasagna (not in photo) are very filling and tasty, enoki tempura is very crunchy and delicious, sisig could be mistaken as the non-vegan version. Need to mention are the house made tea with calamansi and ginger cocktail. Staff Joy is very accommodating and very helpful too.

For an expensive restaurant like this somehow you go beyond so customers are satisfied....Disappointed that there was no extra effort. 

I love the food to be fair and the beef that we ordered is so bloody expensive but worth it. See, I paid so much but was not satisfied with your service. Unlike at Samba, we were treated like royalty but here in Inagiku the crew were just snooty.
