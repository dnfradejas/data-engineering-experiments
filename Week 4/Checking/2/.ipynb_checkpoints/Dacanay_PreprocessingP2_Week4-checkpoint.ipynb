    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the challenges you encountered in gathering data?**\n",
    "    * Multiple formats of string type entries that deviate from your intended format. For you to be able to group similar entries but with different formats, you must be able to standardize them. Finding a optimal way to standardize these formats is also a challenge.\n",
    "    * Ensuring that numbers fresh from surveys to not be interpreted as strings is also a challenge, as this can impact any arithmetic operations that are conducted prior to preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the preprocessing techniques you used to clean the data?**\n",
    "    * The following were used in preprocessing my own data:\n",
    "        * Defaulting NaN values to a constant 'Unemployed' since this was specified in the survey that if the respondent is unemployed, they are to respond with N/A on the City of Work item.\n",
    "        * City name standardization using replacements, unique() function for checking, and str.title() to display first letter capitalized.\n",
    "        * For the other data sets, standardization of continuous variables, using mean as a global constant for NaN continuous variables, and using an \"unknown\" global constant (with stated rational) were other techniques used in this exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why did you perform those techniques?**\n",
    "    * Standardization of the city names were needed in further exploratory analysis should residents from such cities need to be grouped together. And replacement of work city NaN's to unemployed was something the respondents were aware of when they were willing up thus it was appropriate to set this as a global constant for that column."
