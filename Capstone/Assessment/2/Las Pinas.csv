Free breakfast is cold, brown water with a weak comparison to coffee. Toast is not toasted. Scrambled eggs are ok but cold. Room is really ok for the price. A/C working without problems, bathroom ok, much better than price, ok quiet during the night, except the young room attendants had loud conversations.  Again, good for the price and recommendable if the budget is <1500 Pesos.",Jan R,"Slow service, crappy service, no towels provided had to call, uncoordinated staff, check in took a long time, faucet sink not working, non smoking rooms smelled of cigarette, hallways smelled of cigarette, rooms feel like rooms for short time",Adrian C,"This hotel is cheaper and the location is accessible, it is just along the way,walking distance to South Mall. I just don't like that there Blanket is not comfy it is too thin. And they don't give you two keys upon check'in.",Gladys Yama,"I thought i’m gonna have a good night sleep but i was wrong! My family and I stayed in a suite up in the 6th floor. One thing I noticed first was the hallway outside of our room was very noisy. Guests and staffs yelling and talking and a lot of times the staffs pushing something sounded like a wheelbarrow at dawn and in the early morning. AC was also noisy. The room was clean but not that squeaky clean if you know what i’m talkin about. If you’re in a budget, don’t waste your money in this hotel. Hop inn would be nice!",John Doe,"Me and my boyfriend stayed for 4 nights in this hotel they have price stated upfront of the front desk that daily rate is more than 3kphp a night but saw that they hide the actual rate in the hallway going to parking lot for 1649 a night  It's not about the price but the front desk isn't that friendly ,Everytime you ask them something over the phone they neither forget it or just don't care ,guard on the front door seems good and other f&b staff  But the service is really sucks they can't get it even simple request the hallway is full of cig butts ,it takes them too long to clean up the plates and dishes after it was took out from the room ,and bugs are crawling in those utensils , This place need lots of improvements  And they need to change some of there AC's and fix the",Avidtraveller,"Upfront disclaimer - we didn't go there expecting alot.. however even our minimal expectations were not met  Front desk staff - very cold, not welcoming at all.. as if they are there by force and not by choice  Pathway to room - dingy - full of cigarette smoke smell - claustrophobic   Room - ( we booked a standard room ) - frankly speaking small size was not an issue as that's what we get in such low cost.. we understand it. But key issues were as follows: (1) Bed Mattress - was Torn ( it was just covered with white sheet to hide ) . Don't expect a comforter in case you feel cold.. they just provide one thin bedsheet cover. I asked for an extra pillow as we were with our child - they refused saying will charge us extra  (2) Bathroom - Clogged Sink , broken shower, The shower",Prabhjot S,"Wrong info. of 12 hour rate was said to me by the cashier. She said it was for 1,100 but the actual rate was 1,630 pala. It was too late for me to find out na charge na sa Credit card ko. When I get back to her ayaw niya ainin mali sinabi niya. And the management was on her side. Howcome you get to retain employee who doesn't acknowledge her own mistakes. Unethical and stupid!  You should change your name to BULOKTEL! I will never recommend your hotel!",Anna Nica C,"I was with my wife and son. We got the Studio Room no. 220. AC unit barely blows cool air so the room is really warm. The overhead and handheld shower heads don't work, the sink was clogged and there were a few blood stains on the bathroom wall. They transferred us to a new room (room 207) which was ok until I went inside the bathroom: It smelled of urine eventhough the cleaners just cleaned it. Worse, we can hear people talking in the lobby and the guests in the next room arguing over something at 3am which kept me up. I expected walls in hotels to be sound proof and ""the number one business hotel"" to provide their guests with better service than what we experienced. Really bad. Not coming back, ever. One good thing was the guy who assisted us with all our concerns was very",Oni Dee Icon,"Dirty, smoke-filled hallway, old, dingy.  Security is good though.  Front desk staff should learn to smile more.  Requests aren’t handled promptly.  We asked for bucket of ice, extra bed linen, have to wait or be ignored.  Breakfast is “bleeh”. Coffee is good.  Watermelon everyday, no variety.  Food is usually salty.  No fridge. Bath and toilet very dirty.  Towels are raggedy.",ofeliap626,"Last weekend, we booked a Suite 1 in Eurotel, Las Piñas. This hotel have been one of great hotel, I, my friends and loved one tried for years. Still, it does not change for the nice room. And its cleanliness and it's cold.  However, I am just a bit disappointed with some items lacking in the room. First the doormat for the comfort room. May baththub po ito at maganda. But, the other shower functions are not functioning. Also, slippers were not there, I just requested the front desk for the said items.I hope, that the management will look into these small things and yet it is vital for the clients.  The food is quite okay also compare before they have better variety of food.  Overall, it's a nice stay.",Wanderer Eck,"We booked here because of it's proximity to a family gathering we attended in this city. Very convenient especially to our kids as a big mall was just across the street. Overall our stay was pleasant, the room was clean as well as the bathroom. Surprisingly, a bidet was available inside it, yes! Our suite room was on the 6th floor and you can see a glimpse of the city. Further, we had a great buffet breakfast the next morning. The hotel staff are approachable, courteous and polite. We've seen a lot of foreign nationals/tourist that check-in & out of the hotel. We recommend this place for a night stay or more.",Dave_Tan34,"The room given to us has a problem with the bathroom.  The exhaust is not functioning, the shower has no knob, the bathtub stopper got stuck .  We reported the problem at the front desk and we were told that they will send some one to check, we even called the front desk for follow up on our complaint but the night passed with no one checking on the problem and maintainance staff came the next morning after we made a follow up.",jimi d,"Stayed here for 12 hours (thankfully wasn’t longer), and had a really bad experience unfortunately. The studio room I was given had no tissue paper, the bathroom tap wasn’t working and had no water, the toilet looked like it hadn’t been cleaned properly and the sockets were exposed in the bedroom. Totally unsafe. I have stayed in Eurotels before and this was the worsed! The noises coming from other guests past midnight were also so loud it was difficult to sleep. Only thing I could state as positive was the towels and sheets seemed clean and the internet was decent for Manila. Wouldn’t recommend nor would I return, sorry!",Char H,This hotel have comfortable rooms with secure locks. The staffs are helpful and approachable. One thing that I really don’t like in this hotel is that you can smell smoke of cigarette in some public areas.,MCb,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data
