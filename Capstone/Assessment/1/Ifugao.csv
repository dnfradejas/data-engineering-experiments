Banaue Rice Terraces,Nueva Viscaya,Batad,Ifugao,,,,The Ifugao people were highly skilled in carving both wood and mountainsides. The Banaue Rice Terraces is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It offers spectacular views of emerald hues during the rice-growing seasons of April-May and October-November.,"I did several day tours (mostly hikes) ranging from 6-10 hours and did the 3-day homestay hike to Cambulo and Batad. On this homestay hike we trekked for 19 km the first day to Cambulo, and the children sang and danced traditional songs/dances for us- they were wonderful! Everyone knows Robert as he is local, friendly, has served on the Tourism Board and is excellent at explaining, dancing, demonstrating the various cultural practices. I recommend him highly for any activity in the area. He has an excellent driver and will pick you up at the Cauayan Airport for 7000 pesos.",,,Rice Terraces,,
