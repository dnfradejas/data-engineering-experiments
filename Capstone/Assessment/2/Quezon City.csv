The hotel extended my booking for a reasonable minimal cost, and even supplied a huge promo helping of crispy pasta and rice, at 5am in the morning. The rooms are very basic and in the process of very noisy renovations. Unfortunately my room 320 had a bad water leak in the ceiling, necessitating a move across the corridor to 319. Here, the shower unit was in a state of disrepair, a complete wreck! Really awful and cascading water all over the place, like a home-made shower.

No windows in room only traffic noise (constant) could be heard through ill-fitting air conditioner units.  No daily cleaning of room unless we asked specifically.

No towels(need to inform that you need a towel) for sure the supervisor or manager was not that strong to supervise if they even have a checklist.

They have a huge advertisements promo but its subject for availability of the room which is the same as useless.. i will never return again and never recommend for anyone. It feels like you pay and you will be sorry. And there is no any chance of selecting your room or any, they just give you the price with buffet and etc which i didnt request.

For example, I was there at 10am, I booked for 1 day. But check in was 1pm and they had asked me to wait or pay for the early check in which is unimaginable it would make sense if I came really early  but not 3 hours earlier. But credit to them when I mentioned this line of thought they actually did let me check in at around  12pm.

Check-out is fast. The room was clean and cold (aircon worked), not stuffy but no window. The smell of bug spray is noticeable in the ground floor corridor.

It was night time when we came from Pangasinan by bus and we really had no reservations in any hotel near Cubao so we tried to find a hotel where we can stay for one night.  We entered the hotel to do further inquiries we noticed that the receptionist is not quite very welcoming and not smiling at all.  When we approached the receptionist in this hotel to ask if they have any available rooms she said they only have one available room which is the suite room for 4000+ PHP per night.

They can be reached easily by public transport and if you bring your car, basement parking is readily available. The rooms are quite cheap as they offer upfront discount of 50% when you book through them (I highly suggest booking through Agoda or Trivago -- way much cheaper). The hotel is clean and the lobby is cool and organized. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Most of the bookings they offer have free breakfast.

The Room -  The room was plain but expected unfortunately the entire room had a massive stench of urine permeating throughout the place and we tried to get rid of it with perfume and spray; we called the hotel and the cleaning person tried to clean it but also agreed that the smell was unbearable.  Nothing had a lasting effect.   The cleaning person indicated it was a problem with drains.  Requests for a room change were met with ""sorry ma'am no rooms left""...  The cleaner also made the ridiculous suggestion that we leave the window open with the air con on as an alternative.

The rooms are small, no blankets, no air-cond remount, so if you wanna set the temperature you like, you won't be able to do it. Be prepared that there are NO windows in some rooms, due to the dark wall painting and absence of windows you fell staying in a basement. Breakfast is totally not for European taste: fat black sausages, fried creppy fish, rice, weird soup. The only eatable is omlet, no tea, only coffee. The hotel is located in a very busy area, so traffic 24/7. Plus this area is not safe: always have to look after your bag, plus very dirty and old surroundings.",Ksenia C,"In all my years of travelling I have never seen such gross roach infestation in a hotel. When I went into my room the first time I already saw a roach running into base of wall. I immediately left all my luggage's up high and did not leave my luggage open in fear of bring some of these friends home. Over the course if my two days stay I see them running up the wall of the room and inside the bathroom wall and floor. Needless to say I killed them all. On my last night when I needed to pee and lift the toilet seat I saw at least 7-8 baby roaches running under the toilet seat. I did not use the toilet after that.

Of course the breakfast is on going till 10am but standing for more than 1hr to wait for food is irritating. Breakfast is just terrible.

First checking was long and slow (reason is, this is a busy hotel, so book online in advance). Eurotel offers off the street walkings. Checkout was less than a minute (They need the rooms ready quickly, so no time to waste). Eurotel is located on EDSA road but I was tired, so the noise did not bother me. But be aware that some rooms will have street noise. Aircon was excellent, room clean with toothbrush, water and soap. Centrally located near an excellent fish/vegetable market and restaurants.

As for the bed, it was spacious as it was a queen sized bed, I guess, but my only issue is that it was just two matresses joined together, and there is a crevice on the bed that not only is very visible, but also not comforting to lay in.

Will definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.",chrisshasalcedo,"I checked-in so easily at the frontdesk. I was assisted by the hotel boy/guard to my room. The room, Bathroom/ Restroom were clean, however, no change of towels,bedsheet, pillowcase were made during my entire stay. Collection of garbage were not prompt. In short, there was no cleaning service done. I was strictly confined to my room. I was prohibited to bring out but allowed to received particularly my food thru the hotel boy/girl. This was the protocol that I was made to know and aware of which I willingly followed.",antoniocatembung,"I checked out April 26, 2021 at around 4pm. The male receptionist was very unprofessional, I have been calling the reception 5 time already and he was not picking up, when I went to the reception to ask about the check out procedure, he is BUSY PLAYING MOBILE GAMES, and hardly look at me while I ask for my checkout procedure. He is very inefficient, and had this urgency to check and play in his mobile while he is answering my queries, and I feel like I disturb him in whatever it is he‚Äôs doing. He said he cannot reach my house parent while I WAS ABLE TO REACH HIM THE FIRST TIME I CALL. It feels more of like a weird situation more than an inconvenience as this is the first time I encounter a Filipino receptionist/front desk with such antics. This could be improved a lot.  There",diannecamille,"Very disappointed. No one answers front desk telephone. Meal service erratic. Breakfast served almost 8am for duration of stay. Bath towel and bed linen very old and worn out. No bathroom amenities, at least hotel should offer to be purchased. Quarantine status gave no option to buy if not provided. I was more alarmed and insecure due to no one picks up FD telephone. Staff accordingly. Train FD on telephone etiquette and usage.",luissamson,Returened ofw. Quarantine area. The is nice but the water in shower is very low..  Room are good clean.  Staff are friendly.. Internet connection are past. But the tv are not on cable.. the other side of the room can be heard..,capgoespana,"Booked this budget hotel for my 7days quarantine upon arrival in Manila. no that clean room and impolite hotel staff. Good shower, and bed was comfortable enough linens are not that clean While there was no housekeeping service due to pandemic, one can easily relay requests (e.g. new towel, bath mat etc and hotel provided assistance as much as possible. Uncomfortable stayed in this hotel.",candy_nurse,"I stayed here as part of the current protocol to quarantine at least 6 nights after arriving in the Philippines. I was at the  9th floor,a non smoking r√≤om and my view was the LRT passing  along aurora boulevard and some buildings nearby Cubao. Rooms are cozy with hot and cold shower.A fast internet to let you forget the time while being inn the room for 6 nights.TV and a mini ref and the hotel is located along nearby convenience stores.",Winston,Staff is friendly & courteous. Very helpful as well with my needs. The rates are affordable as I‚Äôm looking for a place to stay/quarantine in that has a reasonable price. My experience was great and I would totally recommend this hotel!,StephSum,"Only no toiletries, I was so upset that time coz I can't take shower, I can't go out to buy some stuff such that soap bar shampoo, I thought all are ready to serve, coz it is a hotel. I hope some who booked cannot encounter too....",Cbuena,"I stayed here for quarantine, I think this hotel is the cheapest one I can find. At first I thought the room is okay, until I decided to sleep, I saw all the linens are dirty, so they transferred me to another room. But then the next problem I encountered was the small cockroaches, they are everywhere!",Kzhsnd,"I really enjoyed my stay here at Red Planet Aurora. The rooms are cozy, neat, and the internet is surprisingly fast and stable. The hotel staff are some of the best I have ever experienced. They are friendly, professional, and will go the extra mile to help you, and in my case, secure your reservation from the Department of Tourism.  Thank you Red Planet. You have convinced me you are the best budget hotel chain in the country, and I look forward to staying here again.",ReiNico,"I am extremely impressed with the quality of Red Planet Aurora for its price point. It is clean, quiet, and cozy. The internet is surprisingly fast (though probably caused by fewer guests than usual.)  Special thank you to Issa, the lobby manager, for helping me clear up a major issue with the Department of Tourism. They DoT were trying to have me moved to a lesser quality hotel for their quarantine protocol, but Issa went above and beyond to assist me and suceeded in helping me keep my original, preferred booking here at Aurora.  I feel I am in good hands and I don't mind spending the next 2 weeks here.  The staff is very friendly, professional, and accommodating. I can not recommend this branch enough.",Sirhc Rettop,"a very nice hotel to stay in with someone or with family.The hotel was nearby to malls and markets that you can walk within a minute.There is nearby access for transport like LRT,MRT,Bus and Jeepneys..",acepachenco,"This is the best budget hotel I've ever been bar none! Everything is perfect from the staff service to the hallways and rooms. The room was big and the bed was far from the door which is what I prefer. It was also soundproof from other rooms so you won't hear noises from other guests. The ambiance of the room gives you that modern but comfy and homey feeling. If I were rich, I'd choose to stay here for a loooong long time. They have a 3-in-1 shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel so you don't have to buy those separately if it's okay for you to use other skincare products. The WiFi speed is AMAZING since you have it all for yourself and the password for it is your own surname. How great is that? üòÑ I never experienced any buffs during our binge-watching on Tubi using my phone with",heyabihere,"Comfortable and clean. Will recommend this place to my friends and relatives.

 Quezon City,Tourist Site,Art in Island,No Data,Art Museums,"175 15th Ave. Cubao, Quezon City, Luzon 1109 Philippines",500,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,it's a one-of-a-kind  showcase of art. The 3-dimensional paintings give one a feeling of being one with it.  It allows you  to interact with it and enjoy the  exciting experience. One should know how to do it.  It is also an experience of knowing the special landmarks of other countries.  It's an expereince how to be a child again. :-),Jane V,Explore your creativity on all the pictures you can capture with their backgrounds and enjoy all the amazing things you can do inside the vicinity,milo_dapilos,"This was the second time I've gone to art in island, but this time with my nephew. Looking at the exhibit, even after 3 years, it is very much the same with some parts showing some wear, but not on a lot of exhibits/paintings.There is a new 'wing' but i'd rather call it a hallway and room. It has a separate ticket price but for the novelty, it was worth the experience just once. But this new area needs a good night mode camera/sensor.Overall, it was an enjoyable experience since my nephew had a lot of fun.But I don't see a reason to come back again as it is more of the same.Even the hourly light show (5 to 10minute projection on walls) hasn't changed from years back.There honestly needs to be something else to bring people back.I fear this place is losing visitors, with the exception on mandatory school tours. I really hope they are able to do some changes to entice people to come back.Price isn't the issue, the novelty has worn out for adults as there isn't anything new to take photos of.",84Cerberus84,"Amazing place, worth the visit! Loads of fun.. Sort of stuck out in nowhere‚Äôs land so make sure you take a taxi that knows the area(many who don‚Äôt in Manila) ",Jodi J,"A 500-peso bill, a camera (nevermind the quality), an hour, and a photographer (or model) are all it takes to fill your memory disk in an hour.   Because every painting and every angle give different glimpse of a story, and  you don't want your audience to miss any of it.  The alternative challenge is to shift into a pose that gives a unique story --- that is a photo that can sell.Entrance fee won't be worth the while for all personalities. For those people who are merely curious and care about the beauty of the work, spare yourself from the queue. It's not worth the photo. You can visit the museum via the internet. The work here is fantastic, but for those who are not into arts, it's too much to absorb in one visit, and you'll end up less appreciative, yawning and grumpy in the later parts of the tour. For artists, many lessons can be gained here. For people, who enjoys grooming their virtual profiles, this is a paradise for you.",Daring Darling,A must-vist place for people who love to take photos. Kids and kids at heart will surely have fun taking pictures for FB and IG and whatevers. Bought our tickets through an online app.  It's cheaper and you'll spend less time at the booth. ,wena_anew,"If you are an art lover, you‚Äôll love it here as you use your imagination to interact with all the 3D artworks.  My son was up to the challenge on how to creatively pose for the artworks however during our visit there were other schools as well making it difficult to get really nice or decent shots.  Hopefully, when we come back there would be fewer people.  Be here on a weekday to enjoy the experience.The art show about Creation was nice but they gave Adam wings which is kind of misleading because that‚Äôs not what the Bible says.  Probably, they should recreate it according to the Biblical truth.",Mharl Cua,"This was my sixth trip to Manila, but I had always put Art in Island in the ‚Äútoo far‚Äù basket. What a mistake! This is by far the best attraction in town, regardless of your age or interests. It‚Äôs a huge facility with so many installations to look at and photograph. There are also some English captions to guide visitors on the background of the artwork and how to best take a picture. The staff were superb, always on hand to help and advise and it never felt rushed or hectic. It‚Äôs 500 pesos to enter, and you need to either go barefoot (as we did) or wear the provided slippers. It‚Äôs open from 9:30am till 8:30pm every day except Monday. And if you go, I guarantee you‚Äôll have a new profile picture on some site, somewhere, as well as countless photos to share. Highly recommended!",Saul_True,worth the money. spent the whole 4hrs taking pics. I just wished there were filipino artists involved.,Tina L,"For those who like to pose and take pictures, this is a good place to be. This would be good place to visit when it is raining and when you don‚Äôt want to spend time outdoors. This is also a good place to go on a super hot day as it is cool inside. Do make sure to go when there are not many people visiting the place. A call to the museum can easily give you that information.also make sure that you have enough battery on your gadgets.",Rhea E,The place is nice and recommended for kids and group of friends. A walking distance to the big mall in Cubao area.ideal for taking pix .,remalyn m,The theme is unique but there where NO GUIDE to explain or assist the guest while passing the art concept.,dunn,We were taken to Art in Island by a local and I am very pleased we did so. It was great fun and well worth a visit.,regidorvillegas,It was a great experience. Encourages creativity and photography styling.  Our Pictures looked awesome.,brianandtts,"it's so cool! as a kid, i love creative things and this is the perfect place to unleash my ""hyper-ness"" ",detceleb,"A fun and memorable experience especially for kids and the kids at heart. Amazing artwork that creates realistic illusions. My nephew and I had a wonderful time there, brought out some creative juices in us. A must visit for families in Cubao.",Cassandra Yu,This place is a lot of fun to visit with some great pictures to be had best shared with either friends or a loved one!,Jase,Be part of the art - take photos from prescribed viewpoints to become part of the 3-D paintings and sets. Fun to do with older kids and teens as they will understand the concept of perspective and will have fun posing  and taking photos. Admission includes a short but very entertaining laser light show at 11:00 am. Make sure you bring along an extra pair of socks as shoes are not allowed inside the museum.,Darren B,"Me, my mom and my kids enjoyed our visit here. We had so much fun taking pictures in the Island Museum. This is highly recommended specially to foreign nationals who visits the Philippines. Kudos Art In Island!!!",JAASM,"Best time to go is when you have already eaten and will not go hungry for another 5 to 6 hours.Wear a good socks (some socks seems slippery) or buy from them (what they sell is a good souvenir socks).If you are a student, bring your ID.Drink lots of water, to be honest, its tiring but its fun.Bring lots and lots of picture perfect poses and a large memory for your camera.Always find the camera spot and a good angle or find a staff to take your photo, since pictures won't look good if you just point and shoot.And also, make sure you appreciate/immerse in the art when coming here.. they are really good paintings.",zheeby2872

Its been awhile since i last visit this place. And now I am so nostalgic with the memories I have in this place as i walk in central park here. It is quite amusing and special to me.

I will come back here for sure!",LadyKnight0810,"Though there are full of offices here, there are also malls and lots of restaurants as well as bars.",travelbud.net,Fhis is the place where almost all people are awake during nights because some of then are bpo workers. I love to eat at their eat all you can restaurant.,Most Vicious Players,"The Eastwood city is a mini-city with business centres, call centres, IT companies, shopping malls and restaurants. I had been around this place quite a few times for work and loved it.",Aaqarsh Aiyyar,"but few shops to shop and sometimes it's hot because open area.  Some resto are nice, some are not.  But ambience is really great esp.at Christmas time.",celia0305,"At Eastwood, you will find everything from grocery store, branded stores to plenty of options to eat. Its a fun area to spend time and has alot of variety to offer!",Dale10,"I usually go here for my vacations with my family. Everything is fairly close by and you can never get bored, so many places for entertainment, food, and more. You can easily spend a good amount of time here.",vacationaltravellor,"The traffic leading to the city is a bit of a hassle due to traffic. But upon entering the area it becomes easier to navigate as the traffic is more controlled and directed by guards and signs. There are restaurants, shops and stores and residential condominiums buildings all within walking distance of each other. A nice way to spend the day shopping, eating and taking a walk with people watching.",Gene P,"I lived here for 8 years and I still love going back to this place. It‚Äôs such a happy place for me that I didn‚Äôt have to leave the place because it has everything in it. It has a wide selection of restaurants, cafes, bars, and a couple of retail stores, convenience stores, and gyms. The mall hours are a bit late compared to other malls in the metro but I don‚Äôt mind because then you have somewhere to go after work even if you‚Äôre caught up in traffic. Some of the restaurants are even open 24/7 so you don‚Äôt have to worry if you get hungry in the wee hours of the morning.You‚Äôll never get bored in this place because it has so much to offer. You will be amused by the decors for every season/occasion. There are other sorts of entertainment like mini-concerts, live shows, street performers, etc.During typhoons, you won‚Äôt ever have to worry since many stores and even the grocery store is open.I have considered this place my 2nd home in Manila and I love going back there every once in a while.",Angeli T,Everything you need are inside the city. This is the best place to shop and dine. I hope that they are earthquake ready.,frank ola,"A vibrant place for wandering aimlessly, cinemas, food and other entertainment. Many street stalls have sprouted up with Christmas items for sale.",RAüòé,Smallish mall with some interesting mix of Global and Local brands. Can do with a better mix of eateries but there is a decent Mary Grace and even a Macdonalds in the mall ,Teresa C,"Buildings here are a  mixture of old and new structures. The complex is one of the oldest shopping areas in Metro Manila. In fact there is  a monument honoring call center workers here  since this is the first in the Philippines that hosted BPO offices. The older buildings host mostly dining places and fast food restaurants.The newer infrastructures host call centers, department stores , offices and  grocery stores.The bottom line is this is located near the center of the Metro. It is accessible from the Antipolo, Montalban, Mandaluyong, Rizal and most areas.The only problem here is the traffic during weekends since a major highway (C-5) traverses the area.I suggest be here after lunch so you could park your car effortlessly and wait till sundown to take your dinner here. There are also live bands in the evening. But loud music stops by 10 pm to follow  local ordinances. There is no casino here so this is good for family outlings, like reunion, anniversaries , baptism or weddings.There is an air-conditioned church within the complex. It is ideal of weddings.If you are the religious type, there is another church near the area, a pilgrimage church  for Saint Father Pio believers.It is located near a gasoline station but come early Sunday for parking convenience. The church is crowded but there are flat screens that monitor the masses inside if you could not make it inside the church. So you may take your lunch here since you have only to walk from the church.Everything is here--food, drinks, live band, entertainment, supermarket, cinemas....name it. Or you may rent a condo or a townhouse here. Better buy a unit inside since the entertainment outlets are open until the wee hours of the morning, except that loud noise is banned after 10 pm.",Jolieprincess,"We rented a place managed by Christine Chan, a broker in Eastwood. We stayed in her flat for x number of years, but never got any help with the leaks, clogging drainage, and always broken water pipes. We requested once, but it took us a serious amount of time chasing her, so in our years of stay, we just spent on everything that we need that is supposedly under contract should have been shouldered by the broker-herself/owner. Before we left the place, she told us to repair the parts of the house that we have damaged because they are not part of the expenses she should shoulder based on the contract , and understandably, we hired our own contractor and did the fixing. We did this as she promised to return the deposit if we did; however the same thing that happened to another expat, she just lied and never gave our deposit back! She mentioned that we have damaged more stuff in the house and nothing will be left from our money. The first few weeks we moved to her place, we were so dumb not to double check if everything was OK and working well as we trusted very well, til after a week of stay that we began noticing the clogging commode, leaking pipes, broken sink that we repaired and paid for from our own pockets in the last four years. We left the sink OK and working well, but obviously, she will create stories to not return our money. I am not the only one complaining about this, and there are other reviews about her to attest this. I have receipts of everything we spent to fix her flat, that I have been keeping as proofs that we fixed the flat as many things were broken when we moved in. Too bad. Avoid her at all cost.",Jun Ruaya,The facility is good & the staff are courteous. Numerous shop & restaurants to cater in every niche/interest .,Foxtrot,"There is nothing more comfortable than living in Eastwood City where you can walk, dine, buy groceries, watch live concerts and see a movie all in one place. Should you want to eat or have coffee in the middle of the night or even the wee hours of the morning, you can expect establishments open 24/7 to cater to your cravings. I love how everything is in Eastwood for you to shop or even have your health check-ups.",regidorvillegas,it's quezon city's bgc. the second best city mall. it has hotels and all kinds of restaurants and shops.,Mon C,"just like most Megaworld Developments, Eastwood City looked pretty cool when it opened but now it's all cramped up and congested.
