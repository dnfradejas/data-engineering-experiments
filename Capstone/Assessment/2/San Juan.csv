From the time I was dropped off by the cab and the guard on duty calling the front desk (thank God someone was awake or else I will be sleeping at the lobby and wait for 9am to be checked-in) it was another 20 minutes waiting. I am so tired after being tested for swab at the airport and then this will what I am about to experience.  Upon getting to my room and after unloading my things, the bathrobe was not available. Then the hot water wasn't hot. It was only the water coming out. The worse part of all, the toilet was clogged after using it. I had to relieve myself in the shower every time I had to go pee. Made several calls to FrontDesk but it is already too late as I don't want to disturb them as well.",The Body F,"I booked in February 2020 a hotel room for me and my fiance for a 2-night-stay.  The stay was dated for 29-31 May.   After the outcome of the covid19-pandemic at the end of February and beginning March, I contacted them per phone and email, for a cancellation, or even a „Coupon“ for a later stay.   NO reaction after all. Even over the online-page booking.com(which was the booking partner), was no reaction of my request.  So about 110,- EUR are gone forever.  Thank you Elan Modern!",BLurreD,"Thank you elan to make our wedding perfect it was a beautiful and wonderful experience to celebrate our special day also thank you for the proffesional Staff there all you guys are the best from the entrance front desk to ms. Fay to the waiter, bellman and to the kitchen staff kudos to all of you thank you! big clap for you guys",Tin T,fist of all they wont let you enter their parking with out a room number. so you need to leave your car outside the streets to check in to their lobby before you could enter their parking.  Then they charge the room for 2500 -3000 php. affordable right?. but they will also charge 600 PHP for the parking before you check out. you cant do anything because they will ask for ah 4000 deposit before they will let you check in. AND THEIR CARPET IS SO DIRTY. WHEN MY KID WENT UP THE BED I SAW HIS FEET WAS SO BLACK. SO I LOOK AT MINE FCK IT WAS ALSO SO BLACK. LOOKs LIKE THE CARPET WAS NEVER CLEANED FOR YEARS. i should have taken a photo of it.  This place is my worst hotel experience ever in my whole life.,jamerson tiu,"I was looking for a place to stay near Club Filipino. Our fraternity anniversary could easily spend time till midnight and with the possibility of having some drinks during the fun and fellowship then it would be a better decision for me to stay in a hotel than to drive home to my house 70 kilometres south of Manila. Elan Hotel Modern fits that requirement. Its location is barely a 10-minutes walk to the club. The one thing that doesn’t fit is its name. The hotel is no modern at all in todays world. The rooms although big for the current standards are old in design and features. The air conditioning system albeit cold is quite noisy, the bed  has seen better days and the door lock is still the insert key type. The carpet needs replacement and the bathroom and cabinets are",ynadqnor,"We had our staycation on 01/25/2020 and we choose to get it done at Greenhills Eland New Modern Hotel. We really love the room, it has good view, the bathtub is awesome, the beds were double and the pool area are so great (specially the jacuzzi part) we were the only people whose using it that’s why we love the moments. I could have been perfect if tv has 24 hours cable connection. I would really love to go back again.",Jefferson A,"For people without the usual huge families around during holidays, Elan knows not only to provide engaging events coupled with great food and hospitality, but they also take to heart emulating the very warmth of family in the room where they had us gather together. At the end of the day that stays with us priceless. Long after we've left we will always have how tonight felt like home and family to look back at forever. Elan knows stellar service and excellent love. #ELANderful2020",Robe G,"It is my 3rd time staying at this property and my 3rd reviews for this hotel.  Our room was at the 13th floor and the view is amazing. The room is spacious and clean. Love the multi-function countertop inside the bathroom.  The bed is super comfy and spacious. Wifi inside the room is improving. And most of all, the staffs are very helpful, attentive, accommodating and very patient attending to our needs (through emails and during check-in/check-out).  They say 3rd time is a charm. Indeed it is.",CoCo08,"The room I stayed in was terrible.  The room needs cleaning and it smells like it has just been recently sprayed, maybe for bugs or roaches.  Some parts of the walls, cabinets, and bathroom needed repairs.  The air conditioner needs to be replaced.  Not recommended especially for families.",Roy,"Located right next to the iconic Greenhills Shopping Center, this hotel will most likely be your choice especially foreign shoppers looking for good deals and pearls. The hotel looks dated and, specifically the room I got smelled old. Hotel staff is amazing though.",Lanz Cabrera,Birthday celebrators really had fun. Thanks to our Guest Relations Officer Ms. Nikka for asisting us during our stay. Very convenient for both kids and oldies (because we are with them). Will definitely go back.,Yvn Villaruel,"Staycation with my kids at Elan Hotel was very enjoyable. Hotel staffs are really helpful and approachable, receptionist Jasmine is awesome and so genuine. She really went out of her way to make our stay so comfortable. I never came across a staff as helpful as her, she even helped us on reserving a restaurant where we can eat and she even booked a car service for us not to get lost. Any small problems were dealt with immediately efficiently and always with a smile. Jasmine is a credit and great asset to this hotel as well as her manager Dianne (i met her on the day of our check out). We hope to come back again. The kids also love the breakfast. Such a great stay Thank you Elan!",EliBalaguer,"Most impressive is the size of the room compared to hotel rooms of the same value. It was spacious allowing us to conveniently move about. It’s like a service apartment with a kitchen counter though there are no provisions to cook. At night, from our room on the 37th floor, we enjoyed viewing the city lights. The bathroom though needs a bit of refurbishing since it’s quite old. We were allowed to check-in early without fuss, and check-out was also quick. I’d recommend this hotel for business travellers and families as well. Across the hotel is the famous Greenhills Shopping Center where great bargains can be found!",cabgawtravels,The location is superb. Not as crowdy as Metro Manila. Five minutes walk to Greenhills Mall. Here you have excellent restaurants that not cost a lot but keep very high standard. The Mall here is also more worth visiting due to its not a copy of the super malls around the Philippines. You can find things here as it have a low price market too indoors. Camp Aguinaldo Golf Course and Wack Wack Golf & Country Club is also just a walk away.   Service is excellent with very friendly staff. The restaurant holds a surprisingly high standard. The food is excellent and the service level is top notch. All very clean and tidy.  Rooms was very good indeed. Clean and absolutely fresh.   The view at roof top in the 40 Storey Hotel Residence are awesome. The pool is nice and clean. I wish they,Swe_Viking,"We will definitely go back here for sure!  We stayed here for 2days for the preparation of my Sister's wedding, the place was so relaxing, comfy and very sosyal 😁 The room was clean and well organized. Thank you so much Ms . Ranika Apilado for accommodating us. Will definitely recommend this Hotel! Kudos!",Beatriz Verdejo,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data
 San Juan,Tourist Site,Greenhills Shopping Center,"The crown jewel of the entire Greenhills complex, it has long established itself as a true haven for one-of-a-kind finds and as the go-to mall for specialty categories such as clothing, shoes, pearls, electronics, and more.Read more",Shopping Malls,"Ortigas Avenue, San Juan, Metro Manila, Philippines",0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Oritigas Geenhills Shopping will not answer telephone calls to 63-7210572with the strict lock-down due to pandemic,  few ""essential"" stores are still open. Now less than  10% of usual visitors encountered. In February of 2020 the first 5 cases of Covid-19 in Philippines originated from tourists  who visited there. And there is still a stigma.",lyd,"This is the Philippines answer to Singapore’s SIM LIM.  The place is a bit daunting since it is an actual High-end Mall with brand names and opulence but also connects to a number off floors and different sub buildings which are not shown on their website which are all called the Greenhills Shopping center since all are owned by Ortigas Malls.  As the other reviews mention, the various halls play host to many small makeshift stores selling everything from fake Guccis and Rolexes to real and knock off phones and computers and their repair. Each time I go there, I spend more time looking to find the place I want to go since all these cubicle shops look alike.  I get the feeling there are probably a dozen good repair shops and all the rest serve as middle men doing minor repairs but they serves as middlemen if you need real repairs on you phone or computer.  Also you should expect a little “Puti Tax” since these shops will vary their prices if you look like a foreigner.  Nonetheless, the expansive area can probably offer just about anything you need.  If they do not have something at one store, just ask and they will run to another shop to sell it to you.",Saudi G,"Because of the enhanced quarantine protocols, you must wear a face mask, a face shield and show a quarantine passed issued by the local government to enter the Shopping zone.  People just go to buy groceries nowadays. And it will take 45 minutes to 90 minutes inside the Unimart supermart.Along Ortigas Ave. the 3 lane street @ 1.5 meter wide per lane has been narrowed to 2 lanes for 4 wheeled cars and the 3rd lane for bikes only!. And the road trip time is now longer.  500 meters travel takes about 20-30 minutes Noontime temperature this Sept is 36 degrees Centigrade",c devera,Great mall if you are trying your phone to get fixed or if you are looking for a more affordable but fashionable dress.,travelbud.net,"The whole complex closed since March 16 due to lockdown and quarantine., except UNIMART. I go to buy vitamin/ supplements.  Other locations: Tokyo Tokyo resto, Kenny Rogers resto, and Chowking King and Jollibee and LeChing and halal foods. Ace Hardware, Watsons.",c devera,"I visited Greenhills last February 2020 to shop for winter OOTD clothes for my sister's trip in Japan. The items are really cheaper compared to mall prices. However, one must be very patient to go to every shop in order to look for the cheapest negotibale price. One must also be very meticulous in inspecting for clothes bags or any items before buying to make sure that it is of good quality. Also, be mindful of your personal belongings especially when there are many shoppers. The establishments will not be responsible for any loss. There are also restaurants in the area where you can stop by for snacks, lunch or dinner after shopping. ",uja,"Fascinating place to shop!  Large electronics section with  lots of iPhones and accessories cheap.  They have brand name shoes, clothes and bags. Lovely jewelry, they even had furniture.  I'm not a big shopper and don't care about brand names, but if you want Coach, Gucci, Kate Spade bags they had tons.  Pretty sure they were knock offs but they looked nice.",Elaina L,"This mall represents the old era of malling, a favourite pastime of Filipino families spending their precious bonding moments in an air conditioned building that houses restaurants, retail shops and outlets, boutiques and even a supermarket. It can not be denied however that this mall has lagged behind in terms of modern design, convenience and functionality that is inherent to the present day fashionable and trendsetting style of the newer and modernistic malls in the city. It can be told that it has seen better days. In spite of this disadvantage it still exudes the aura of an old but functional and fun place to visit.",ynadqnor,Shopping in green hills all alone was fun and it's kind of an adventure because there's a lot of pop up store's,Clyde Q,"GSC is still a great place to shop. The variety of wares and restaurants/cafes are such that you won't be satisfied with just a day's visit.Parking is really a problem though, and sometimes the throngs of people whom you have to compete with at that desired watering hole or resto of yours.",Karen G,"Greenhills is large and sells low cost [largely knock offs] goods - shirts, shoes [the Philippines appears obsessed with sports shoes.. you can find all sorts here and i have to say the quality is not too bad!].   But my favorite is the jewellery section - go for the pearls but ensure that you dont get coerced. each shop will tell you that you are their first customer.  As you walk through, you can see which ones offer better quality products. I have been to the shop called AJ-Nor twice and each time the pearls are good stuff.  If anything, you should just go and see it for yourself.  The downside is that it is so packed you need to watch your bags and the toilets are not too nice.  And during peak hours or weekends, you may have to wait a long time for transport!",tumblentumbleweeds58,"Love the new and improved Greenhills Mall. It is a combination of department store style shop owners and lots of kiosks/small stalls they call Tiangge. It reminds me of the QV Market in Melbourne or Paddy’s Market in Sydney and evening similar to Myeongdong in South Korea the go to for cheap souvenirs, cheap fashion, foods, and Knick-Knacks and luxury brand Knock offs. The difference is this particular centre is organised under one roof and inside an air conditioned building so it is pleasant to shop year round wether it rains or shines. It is always hot and humid in the Philippines so I love that I can take my time haggling with vendors in a nice indoor and clean setting. Green Hills has fashion, accessory, toys and packed food items that are perfect to take home by tourists who like the Filipino snacks or returning Filipino nationals who loves to bring back a taste of home. There’s also an array of food choices in the surrounds. There’s a play zone to leave young kids so they can have fun while parents shop without feeling guilty. Filipinos normally would have a nanny with their kids at the play zone and for safety it would probably be best to have someone looking over and not leaving kids on their own. For all sorts of safety reasons.",justcameback2015,"Too many stalls of all the same things, if you want a cheap knockoff bag do you go to the first stall or the 20th stall as they were all selling the same looking ones. If you want cheap stuff place to go but wasn’t what I call nice shopping.",Johanna A,If you are looking for Brand Bags and Shoes ( replica) this is the place you want to shop in affordable price.They also have places to dine and you just have to choose what food do you want to eat.I’ll visit again here next time.,Neen5169,"Maybe one of the best places to shop and test your haggling skills. They have a whole section dedicated to just cellphone and cellphone accessories.  A good place to buy clothes, bags and shoes( lots of knockoff though).",monalizah5486,"Skip this place if you wanted to buy good stuff still better if u go to divisoria or tutuban and makati cinema square for your cellphone accessories. I went to greenhills to buy and trade my phone but ot looks like price here is a lot way expensive than makati cinema square cellphone center, and its too crowded now, store owner here are very intimidating ending of my shopping...not so good and im disappointed for the outcome of my shopping",Rolly,"Availability of different types of merchandise and gifts that the traveler may need at lower prices than other shopping areas, and of acceptable quality, but not of the top qualities.",travelmate,"This place is amazing for shoppers who look for some budget shopping. One gets all kinds of products and large selection of imitations. Most of these products though imitations, seems to be of good quality. While bargain is a absolute must, prices seemed to be standardised across different outlets. But bear in mind, the quality also differs substantially. Such markets are very prevalent in China and other SE Asian countries, but I believe this one is really large and best. Don't forget to visit the mobile market/repair shops in the first floor. Very interesting indeed. At times, the shopkeepers are pushy and rude but it pays to be polite and turn it away. One can spend an hour to a day depending on what one wants. Pearl market seems to be interesting but may not be wise idea to shop without any support from local friend.",202Abdullah,Ah greenhills lots of things you can buy with a cheap price yet a quality product if you're looking for one try to go to greenhills u wouldn't even realize that u forgot what u were looking for but get home with a bunch of shopping bags heheand its quite fun just to window shopping..,SaranathPS,All kind of goods rather cheap often lesser quality and the pearls are popular but don't know if it will be a good buy probably too expensive for low quality or even fake pearls. In general all look bad quality and a lot of fake products !! be alert ! lots of restaurants lots of choice. If you have to kill some time greenhills is an option. Huge area with all kind of goods. Bargain is you like to buy something is the message !,Zarah Jane C
