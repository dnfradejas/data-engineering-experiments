Taal Vista Hotel,Tagaytay,Aguinaldo,Calabarzon,Fitness Center with Gym / Workout Room,4194 to 6110,261.0,"Tubbataha Reef is regarded as one of the top diving spots in the Philippines, and perhaps, the world. Located at the heart of the Sulu Sea, it is considered a center of marine biodiversity and a haven not just for divers but marine conservationists as well. The only way to get to this marine sanctuary is through a liveaboard vessel from Puerto Princesa, Palawan. ",Awesome hotel. My family and I were here around the holidays. Beautiful views of the water and mountains. I also enjoyed the live music and drinks at night. Perfect place to relax - we even got in-room massages. Breakfast buffet was worth it - get there early. The dinner buffet I wouldn't recommend though - much better places to eat in the area,,,,,
Tagaytay Wingate Manor,Tagaytay,Maitim,Calabarzon,Fitness Center with Gym / Workout Room,13333 to 13481,24.0,"As soon as your flight lands at the airport in Legazpi City, the worldâ€™s most perfect volcanic cone, and the most active volcano in the Philippines, greets you with its majesty. Mayon Volcano is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Philippines and is a top attraction in any Bicol tour.","Place is a bit far from the highway not to mention the road is under construction, you need to take a trike going there easier to go in/out for those who have a private car. No food shops nearby so better buy at the restaurants by the highway but place is quiet and peaceful for those who wants to destress and relax. Staffs are friendly and the place is well kept. Price is reasonable, with complimentary 1 hour massage and a plated breakfast. Room has basic amenities and slippers.",,,,,
Hotel Kimberly Tagaytay,Tagaytay,Kaybagal,Calabarzon,Fitness Center with Gym / Workout Room,3200 to 4420,50.0,"Locals and foreign visitors from Manila often take a quick escape from the megacity and make their way down south to Tagaytay, a relaxing town famous for its cool weather and magnificent views.","Everything was flawless. Starting from the booking of the reservation up to the dinner date. The Valentine's package they offered was super affordable, and I wasn't expecting that much from the food because of the price but the hotel surpassed my expectations. We had 2 starters, pasta, 1 main course and dessert. I requested for a proposal set up and my request was granted with ease. I couldn't ask for a better proposal at all. Thank you hotel Kimberly and thank you all the staf",,,,,
Taal Volcano and Lake,Tagaytay,,Calabarzon,,,,"Locals and foreign visitors from Manila often take a quick escape from the megacity and make their way down south to Tagaytay, a relaxing town famous for its cool weather and magnificent views.",Recently exploded but rare to see Volcano in island. Very near Manila and well worth seeing. Lots of Hotels and Eateries. Easy to and Starbucks overlooks Taal,,,Lake,,
Pagsanjan Falls,Laguna,,Calabarzon,,,,The only thing more exciting than admiring one of the most notable waterfalls in the Philippines is traversing it in a dugout canoe. The Pagsanjan Falls waterfall is part of the Pagsanjan Gorge National Park.,"We had such a good morning. Stayed at Casa Del Rio and they sorted the boat for us. 1250pp seems expensive but is definitely worth it. The scenery is stunning and we saw plenty of wildlife too, monkeys, kingfishers, and a woodpecker. Easy to do on your own. We got the HM liner bus from Cubao for 166php each. Jeepney from Santa Cruz to Pagsanjan. Cheaper than some of the tours advertised, even with a night in Casa Del Rio.",,,Falls,,270
