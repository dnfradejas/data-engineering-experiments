Corregidor Island,Corregidor Island,,Cavite,,,,"A tour of Corregidor Island is a must-see for history buffs visiting the Philippines. The island played a significant role in World War II and was the location of several battles. The relics left behind from these battles include secret tunnels and bunkers used as hideouts during the war, as well as weapons, barracks, and historical artifacts.","The scenery was just beyond words the first time I saw everything from the ferry. Make your way up to the cliffs where they had the artillery pieces, and you'll see exactly what I mean. Plus, the whole island's set on some pretty interesting Philippine history. I seriously did not regret a single second of it.",,,Island,,200
