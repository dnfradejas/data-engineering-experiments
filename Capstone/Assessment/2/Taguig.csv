The room itself was spacious,",saf7670,"This has to be one of the worst hotels I ever stayed at. First of all check in was 2 PM but they couldn’t get their act together until 230, then they tried to hit me up for another thousand peso security deposit which I refused. But honestly they need to shut the hotel down until they get their plumbing problems fixed. Immediately the sink was leaking water. They came and fixed it but then the sink started backing up. The most unbelievable issues is they didn’t want you using toilet paper in the toilet. I say what, is this a joke? No Westerner would find that acceptable. The restaurant on the fifth floor was nice but that’s the only last thing I can say nice about this horrid place",Dan S,"My Family and I stayed at this Hotel and we were in awe about the interior, the lobby has this star like lights that if you look up, you can imagine looking at the galaxy. They also have a lobby cafe that lets you drink coffee and eat pastry while waiting for your room or while waiting for personal reasons. As we went up the City Twin, we were very happy to see 2 queen size beds that can fit us. The bathroom is spacious and they had hot and cold shower. They also have a nice roofdeck view of the city and they also have a delicious and affordable food menu. They are more of filipino style but the servers told me that they will have soon some more for the menu. Overall we really enjoyed and had fun even if they don't have much amenities.",Merlinda James F,Costumer service was great!  For sure I’ll be coming back!

Must look like a ghost city during the pandemic ",Elena Ciocan,"The malls and the park here is very relaxing, comparing it to Makati I find this place much better. I love going here to have a walk and enjoy time with friends and family.",travelbud.net,"My first time in Bonifacio on a weekend trip to Manila in Feb 2020. A surprisingly modern place with some decent hotels, restaurants and cocktail bars. Also very easy to walk around, which makes for a nice change from other parts of the city. Really feels like a modern international city here.",KGB777,Very clean and interesting city!  When you're around here you'll forget that you're in a third world country.  Clean and modern with lots of nice shops and restaurants.  Walked around to take note of the amazing mural on some of the buildings.  They were just so fabulous!,luxetrip,"Very clean, suitable for all ages. The place has everything you need, malls, cafes, parks, offices. Wish I live here",AJ I,"BGC is one of the most posh places in Manila. It’s a popular and high-end business district with plenty of business activities and areas for shopping, dining, and entertainment. For posh malling experience, Uptown Bonifacio and The Grand Canal at McKinley Hill are great places. The Grand Canal also has that Italian feel in it and you can enjoy riding the gondola. Market Market and SM Aura are huge malls. Market Market has plenty of options for food, and has plenty of transportation options to other parts of Manila.Bonifacio High Street is an outdoor shopping and dining strip with shops at both side of the pedestrian street which has a relaxing park-like vibe.When you’re in BGC, you’ll feel like you’re transferred into a different world if you entered from the somewhat chaotic environs. Within the business district, electric cables are buried underground, so the city views are orderly. There are green spaces and plenty of high rise buildings.You could also walk from one end of the city to the other, and the air quality is much better compared to most areas in Metro Manila.",Makoto,"High Street in Bonifacio Global City is the place to be when visiting Manila, Taguig City. The pedestrian area, lined with greens and small parks has a nice atmosphere to it. It is a busy place and popular with young people and families. You can safely walk all the way up and down the couple blocks and enjoy the vibe. High street is full of brand stores and restaurants and cafés of any kind. Come here for an afternoon or an evening out with friends and enjoy the delicious foods and buskers. Enjoy the water features and greens and fresh air. ",inhale-exhale321,"An adventurer's mecca. A walkabout Bonifacio GLOBAL City will certainly satisfy your adventure curiosity from High Street, Mid town, Market Market and SM AURA.

There are alot of bars to stay at this place and get merry. ",Nico Samneil Sy Salado,High end street - nice place to chill.  A business district with shops where you can find whatever you need from food to clothes. Luxury brand hotels nearby good for staycation with family as well.,Jane S,"My husband and I stay in BGC whenever in Manila, which is almost every year for the last 4 years.  Here you will find first-world accommodation (airbnb or hotel), restaurants, cafes, parks, bars, shopping, banks, services, etc....and yes, just about everything is overpriced compared to other Philippine cities and villages (minus Makati)...but it is the price you pay for seeking first world comforts and standards here. It’s a bit strange to have such a place in a third world (developing) country with typical chaos, poverty and pollution just outside the city limits.  However, we like it because of the safety, sanitation and convenience factor.  It’s also just an easy 20 min away (mb less outside rush hour) from the NAIA terminals where you can fly to any beautiful, peaceful and more authentically Filipino places.",Nancy de Guia,This area has really been built up over the past 10 years. Lots of shops and restaurants. Activities at night. Relatively safe to walk. Good fun. ,mabuhay878,It is great to see a lot of people .. It is great place to have meet up with friends.

Has movies, parks, dogs 🐕, supermarkets, restaurants, offices, etc. Why leave...",sauraumpfa,"We dine in Mango tree- the food are good and the staff are courteous.We talk a walk/ stroll, watch people to break life city monotony Of always working.Then take to watch a movie, we also fetch my grandchildren from playing in a designated area in BGC.Good to spend weekends with the family.All of us enjoy, children and adult alike.",pinyinok,"Lots of restaurants, shops, malls and open spaces, great place to hang out with family and friends. Children love it.",Kizomama,"BGC by the name it has, its a definite Global City with the skyscrapers and the Global companies, tidy roads, green lawns etc. except the traffic congestions which everyone locally aware of it. If you take someone who was fall asleep from Manila airport to BGC and he woke up, he wont believe that you are in Manila. He would feel that you took him to the US or some other Global cities.  Worth to look at the city from a skyscraper during night time.  ",Cato K
