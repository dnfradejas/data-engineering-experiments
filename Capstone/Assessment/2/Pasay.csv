It's cold. But it's impersonal. Sound system is bad for concerts unless outsourced, as with chance the rapper in 2018. But none thugs and harmony had bad sound, not good for the beats. Parking is hard for events and foreigners abound who have taken over Pasay City, making it even harder to get around or park. The vip lounge is too high to enjoy anything on court. Furthermore, it splits lower from upper box so sitting in upper box is like being in gen ad. So not worth it as its vertiginous already.",LKMT,"This is a brilliant complex, very bright and lean lots of shops and restaurants, wheelchair accessible love the mall ",Katy,"We really enjoyed our meal here, the place was really tiny but everybody was so friendly..we will definitely come back, we recommend anybody to go...",Ryan A,"Watched Disney on Ice here. We booked the tickets online as per experience, its always the quickest and convenient way. Well, its the exact opposite here! If you book a ticket on line, you will have to print the voucher, and go to their ticket station to still get the actual ticket. What's worst is that, the security team here looks like they dont know what they're doing. There are 2 counters with multiple lines!! Online purchase of tickets will also cost you more!! They charge 100 pesos per ticket purchased online for convenince fee to undergo their inconvenient process!!! It was my first time to watch here and will be my last. The seating areangement also doesnt have leg room! If you book a seat at the middle of the row, the only way to get to your seat without bumping another person is by flying! Its impossible to pass within the row without hitting another person! I do not recommend this place and i feel robbed buying tickets online!!",Macky M,"very clean and spacious place,close to City,lots of interesting things & places to go and shop. friendly people all around, including staffs in each shopping place.located close to the Ocean, very beautiful ocean views on south side mall. prices are affordable.",kumarprasad00,My first time at this venue - thought it was excellent - good friendly service - good food - seats were comfortable with good views despite being pretty high up.

I find it expensive though.  If you are into sprawling malls and do not mind walking around endlessly, then this is the place for you. It you are the ""buy and go"" type, then a corner shop will do. For me,  nothing special. It is just a mall just like any other malls.",Peter P,"Enjoyed a couple of mornings here, exploring the shops and finding lots of bargains. Make sure you walk right through the mall to get a view of Manila Bay. Lots of eating places that cater to all tastes. ",Alexis V,"The Conrad has a covered bridge into the Mall.

Was able to shop quickly before I left for my flight.,Mr Prinz,You can find luxury goods here... enjoyed the event that was currently in the mall center that time. we had good food by barcino's and dessert at crisostomo's. ,Fred,"We were impressed at the huge complex built here in Newport City so close to Manila International Airport. With the Runway Manila walkway opened the casino complex is only a 20 minute walk from your pl√†ne. If that is too much to walk there is a complimentary shuttle that runs 24/7 from the runway terminus. On the Runway there is a Resorts Casino booth and it is there you should make your first stop. The friendly employees will copy your passport picture onto your loyalty card which they will give you right then and there along with 500 pp in free play and a free gift ( some casino swag). With the loyalty card you can also get 300 pp every year on your birthday. The casino complex is mega with a hotel, several restaurants, a shopping mall, a coffee shop and a bar.the main casino is at ground level but there are more gaming areas upstairs especially high roller rooms. No photography allowed inside the casino, the pictures we took were at the entrance and the Chinese New Years decorations in the casino. The casino is mostly (80%) geared to Chinese clientele. There are table games we have never seen in the States but from what we heard you stand a better chance to win. The slot machines were not too tight. No longer free cocktails; don't know if soft drinks are still free. While we were there no cocktail waitress approached us.Therw was a large bar in the middle of the room. We were told there is nightly free live entertainment. Regretfully no dance floor. Rest rooms were spotless but only one location and that is next to the Cage.  The casino appeared clean and well ventilated. Did not appear to be too smokey. The furnishings may be a bit dated. We are used to American casinos with dim lighting so this one with the bright ceiling lights was a bit off putting at first. Perhaps this is how the Chinese gamblers prefer. All throughout the casino employees are extremely friendly. This extends to the security guards",MountaineerLu,"The mall is like a city within a city.....lots of hotels, designer shops and excellent restaurants to choose from. Some section of the mall is being repaired due to a terrifying incident that happened few years ago. The mall is clean and beautiful.",Tenkid,"A bit smokey at times - usual run  of amenities and distractions - convenient to several hotels at various price ranges,+",Fr.

Also good if you have a overnight stay for a connecting flight.Full of high end shopping, casinos , movie complexes, their is a bit to see and do. Food is fantastic at a'lot of the eateries.  Not cheap though.",Darryn,"Although it‚Äôs a magnet for casino lovers, there are also a myriad of activities for those who will not play at the casino. Although I don‚Äôt play casino, I just took a look of the casino floor. It‚Äôs vast and high-end, and taking photos is prohibited.The complex has restaurants and shopping, where the prices are exponentially high if you compare to other parts of Manila. Many of the people who come here are tourists and overseas Filipinos. The vicinity around the area has a European feel, and it has several high-end hotels, which offer a convenient place to stay for travelers.",Makoto,It was a pleasant experience roaming around the complex. Would love for the casino to implement the no smoking or designated smoking area to attract more visitors especially at the 360 bar.The complex  offers a wide range of entertainment and restaurants for food enthusiasts.All is Well...,HooverSP,"I head out here when waiting for a flight in Terminal 3 or after arriving and take my ride here cheaper compared to coming from airport.  Its a different story if I have large luggage‚Äôs though.  It‚Äôs walking distance with accessible air-conditioned enclosed bridge from the area of resorts world to the terminal.  There are cinemas, the casino, coffee shops, restaurants and shops.  I‚Äôm not a gambler I‚Äôd head out here for coffee/eat before I go to the airport.  Last time I was here was my birthday month and they gave me a free cake yumm! For having a resorts world card, no purchase required.",Wanderer785704,For it being so close to the airport it surely didn‚Äôt feel like it when I walked it with luggage. Terrible communication on how to get to and from the airport to the sky bridge did not help matters. Add on top of that bad/missing or poorly designed sidewalks and overall this ‚Äúcity within a city‚Äù felt like an afterthought.,Yvet D,"Located near Naia3 international airport, Resort World has 3 five star hotels including Marriott, Sheraton and Hilton. 3 three star hotel, Marriott convention centers, casinos, branded stores and restaurants, live stage theater.

Upon arriving the airport go straight towards right side of the building there you can see signs leading you to the fascinating pedestrian. There were also fast foods and restaurant along the side.

It‚Äôs very clean place and a pleasant janitress.",mjlee,"An air-conditioned walkway bridge between NAIA terminal 3 and Newport City. Newport City houses several hotels which are just across the road from the airport, and offers excellent accommodation especially for those who want to avoid traffic jams on their way to the airport. The hotel would just be a few minutes walk to the airport. The restaurants at Terminal 3 offers more affordable meals compared to the restaurants at Newport City. If you stay at any of the hotels at Newport City and you prefer more affordable meals, you can leisurely pass through the pedestrian bridge and get a meal at one of the restos at NAIA Terminal 3. ",Makoto,"Whoever thought of putting in this pedestrian short cut from Newport City to Terminal 3 of Manila Airport was a genius. It opened up that development to airport traffic as well as opening up all the airport eateries on level 4 to people in Newport. The main reason was to get traffic to the casinos there especially Resorts World and it works. There is a booth halfway across the bridge where you can sign up for Resorts World loyalty program. The pedestrian walkway is air conditioned, there are moving walkways and golf carts to take you across upon request no charge, no tip expected but gladly accepted.Two sets of security checkpoints coming from Newport so you feel safe. There are restrooms, good signs and it is well lit. Perhaps one could have preferred more subdued mood lighting at night for tired travelers but that is not a major consideration. There are elevators on both ends and luggage carts are available at no charge. At the Newport side there is a plethora of shuttle busses available (free) to take passengers to the hotels, restaurants and casinos there. They run 24 hours a day and are free. Unless you have a large amount of luggage most of the destinations bin Newport can be walked to in less than 10-15 minutes. The walk is pleasant and the neighborhood very safe. It would be nice if the other terminals in NAIA were connected to Runway Manila.",MountaineerLu,"My boyfriend needed to get a haircut at Bruno's Barber so we had to went out of the airport before our flight. From NAIA Terminal 3, we walked at the Runway and had a ride shuttle ride for free to New Port City. The shuttle leaves every 30 minutes.

",Anastasya Gladys,"If you are a traveller and you want to relax before or after your travel, Runway Manila is the best place i would recommend. You can eat and shop and relax and after just go towards the transfer desks of the airlines if your flight is not in terminal 3. Or if you arrived early and your check in time is still after 1pm, you can wait in Runway Manila and after go to Belmont Hotel or ride a taxi at Belmont Hotel because its easier than in T3 itself or Vans are available for free if you are going to Marriot Hotel or Holiday Inn.",ManilaPat,"I arrived at NAIA 3.  With a bad cough and start of a cold, and desperately needed a pharmacy.   The nearest one was Watson‚Äôs in the Resorts World complex.   I then noticed that the Runway, footbridge was open.   So it made it a simple 10 minute walk to Resorts World,  no dodging traffic, no taxi queue, just a simple comfortable air conditioned stroll.",Ricardo,"Staying at RSW properties is but a breeze with Runway Manila. You may have the option to take their shuttle at the ARRIVALS but could mean long waiting time. With RUNWAY, you just walk off the traffic underneath you, literally. When staying in Belmont, it is just behind the hotel. A shuttle service awaits to bring you to your RSW Hotel.",saf7670,We stayed at One Palm Tree Villas during our arrival and departure.  From Terminal 3 arrivals you need to take the escalator upstairs to the food court that will direct you towards the walkway. 5 minutes and Super safe! When you exit the building you just walk around the front of the Mc Donald‚Äôs and Filling station/Gas Station and up the next street on which the entrance gate for One Palm is.  The next day we took a domestic flight with Philippines Air so we used the walkway again and was able to take a free shuttle from Terminal 3 to 2.

I read about Manila‚Äôs seafood market called Dampa and knew I just had to pay a visit.  It is a wonderful display of just about any seafood possible bordered by multiple restaurants waiting to cook it for you.  Everything is ultra fresh, most of it is still alive.  The procedure is you first choose your seafood from any of the numerous wet stalls and then choose which restaurant you want to cook it for you.  You really can‚Äôt get fresher than this set up.  This would be a must visit for any seafood lover visiting Manila.  Anthony Bourdain paid a visit here to try the freshest seafood in the Philippines.  Even if you‚Äôre not a seafood lover and don‚Äôt intend to dine here it is still a very interesting place to visit with many great photographic opportunities.  Most of the vendors are extremely proud of their displays and welcome photos.  ",Steven T,"Seaside Dampa is a large fish market where you can buy your seafood and have them cook (for a fee) at adjacent restaurants. Seafood is absolutely fresh, but also comes very expensive so be prepared to spend at least USD 40-60 per person, much more if you chose pricey items like lobsters or sea mantis.",ochassot,"Cravings were satisfied but got shocked as our pockets got empty!We did not go to the market and buy our own, we asked them to do it for us. A whopping Php 2,500 for two persons. No doubt they served good food, we had a kilo of crab, half kilo of shrimp and clams for soup.Though they were plenty -- I still find it pricey! The ambience also has to be improved so they can attract more customers.",Marifi M,"Food is good  that is our 2nd time, carefull lang kau sa pag order becoz sa menu nila akala mo cheap yong mga price kc ang nakasulat lang doon yong price ng service charge ng paluto kaya you must ask the waiter para hindi ka magulat sa bills mo",Bhang,"The food is great, but this place was so Expensive. We bought seafood outside the restaurants. We are super  suprise when we knew the price. Oh my God, we buy worth 2800 seafood and we pay 800 for the cooking. We are only 3 who will eat that foodCrabs: 1400 per kiloSquid: 1200 per kiloShrimp:1300 per kiloAnd we buy fish I forgot the name worth 500 per kilo. P.s: that is not yet cooked",Joy Lirazan,Food looks good but please beware of so many unscrupulous restaurants there (which are mostly owned by mainland China men operating business in the area). Menue price is for cooking charge but their actual price of meat / seafood are quite exorbitant. Ambiance is mostly targeted towards Chinese foreigners who frequent the area and cost is no object to them.,yujioka,"We came here expecting to have a good and fresh seafood feast. We went to a place that appears to be a Chinese restaurant but the owner/in charge was not involved with the customers at all. Only the locals(wait staff) where talking to us, promising us 1kg per dish (we didn‚Äôt havetime to buy it ourselves as we were already really hungry‚Äîbecause traffic!) with 350php cooking fee per dish (a bit steep than usual but again, hungry). The dishes came and we dug in straight away, of course. Halfway our dinner, one of my friends mentioned that the crabs looked really ‚Äúempty‚Äù, then we noticed the prawns that looked less than a kilo. The sizzling squid was the same. We asked for a breakdown of the bill and realised that they have charged us way more than the amount of food (based on weight). When questioned, that‚Äôs when their demeanour changed. They were defensive, changed their stories (700gm per dish apparently, and not 1kg as previously agreed) and threatened to call the cops. We challenged them to please make sure the police gets involved to clear things up. Of course, no police came. In the end, we had to go to the market to check the prices and we paid them according to that price (like they initially promised us) but only for 500gms, not per kilo (because clearly, it wasn't a kilo). The initial bill was almost 7,000Php but we only paid 5,000php after we calculated what we think is fair and just. No one wants to talk to us anymore (the wait staff left the premises and the Chines ‚Äúowner‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem to care) so we left the money on the table and left. So never again in that horrible, horrible place. That was an expensive lesson learned.On the lighter side, Dampa in Alabang is apparently the better one with clear prices and dishes delivered as expected. We will be trying it out next year, so fingers crossed, it will be a total opposite experience and we can‚Äôt wait! We‚Äôre not giving up on dampa, not yet. üòâ",Eric Uy,"Had a great time browsing around the market stalls to check on the wide variety of seafood available. We bought our favorite crabs , live prawns , scallops, oysters & had them cooked at the Hongkong Restuarant.The garlic rice & vegetable from Restuarant was good & they have also done a good job of cooking the seafood.Enjoyed ourselves tremendously digging in to those fresh seafoodSH",LiaLia,"if you are into seafood and grilled meals, then seaside dampa is a heaven's treat for you. there are lots of restos within the site and you will find the best ""paluto"" amongst them. try al so their garlic butter shrimps, chilly crabs and grilled liempos. you have to do the marketing first at the palengke within the grounds. try to haggle for the best prices, and avail of their discounts for paluto service. most restos offer beer and other liquor stuff.",Siew Hoon S,"It was my 4th visit in Trinity Restaurant in Dampa Macapagal. The previous 3 visits were ok that's why it became a fave restaurant for me. But Last night, was TERRIBLE! I bought 1 1/2 kgs of squid, 1 1/2 kgs of tahong /mussels .I know the QUANTITY of what I bought when it gets cooked. BUT when the waiter served our food, It was NOT AS EXPECTED, our squid in oyster sauce cut in small pieces was just 1 plate. steamed oysters and baked tahong  were just a few pieces  on 2 plates and when I asked the waiter about it he just said ""yan na yun"" !!!!!!! they LESSENED (BINAWASAN) THE QUANTITY OF FOOD I bought to be cooked. Well that is what I call another form of stealing. DO NOT EAT IN THIS RESTAURANT . if you do not want your food lessened when it gets served to you. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!",anythingpinoy,"Dampa or shanty is located near Manila bay seaside with a fresh seafood market and restaurants who will cook the seafood you purchase from the market.  After picking your choice of restaurant and type of recipe they cook the food and served at your table. JThe food is so fresh and sweet and we chose traditional Filipino recipes such as fresh lato (seaweed), sinigang na isda sa miso, adobong pusit was so tasty, steamed alimango (crab). And the best part is that the prices are reasonableI. Make sure you haggle when buying your seafood.  Oh an grab a fresh coconut and enjoy the coconut water as well. ",Toni,"After my 3 weeks USA vacation, it is time to feast with seafood favorites at Aling Tonyas.We bought the ingredients from the nearby seafood Market and brought these for cooking at Aling Tonyas.After the meal and endless burping, you can say that you have satisfied the cravings. ",Glenn Dabatos,"This is the place to be for fresh and tasty seafood. You walk the market and pick what seafood you want, make sure you check the prices per kilo as they really vary per stall. Once you have what you want you pick the restaurant to cook it again check the prices before you decide. We went to the super wok ( about half way down the lane way) as it was really busy and a great price. I dont think you can go wrong with a restaurant filled with locals. We got our prawns cooked in garlic butter and our crab in chilli. A must eat is the garlic rice.   ",Michael San Diego,"If you want great seafood, this place is where you wanna be. Pricy but you‚Äôll love their sweet chili crab and buttered prawns. It was amazing! We loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è",nicknox83,"This is what you do to get the most out of this place.....specially the tourists...tip 1)  Buy your seafood inside the market first...just ask for the best price..don't be intimidated...there are stalls alongside the road but there are more stalls in the back..probably with better prices..2) pick your restaurant...in my experience the best restaurants in that area are the big ones in the corner...the big chinese restaurants...if you don't like to go to the market or you are pressed for time you can just order from their menus...but their prices are probably double vs buying your own supply...3)when i go there i just usually buy crab and shrimp and maybe fish or scallop...i then have it cooked maybe butter garlic...sweet chili sauce...or salted fish style...it used to cost 300 per kilo for the salted fish style... i then order the rice, drinks and the soup from the restaurant itself...the last time i went we spent about 3000 for two people...4) do not go with the people there trying to get customers...the big restaurants usually do not have to do this...although if you're always there you can try the smaller ones..since they probably charge less...these are the ones patronized by the local customers who do not want any fancy cooking...5) the cooking price is by kilos...usually a minimum of one kilo...if you don't want seafood there are also meat and poultry at the market in the back...as well as vegetables..but this place specializes in seafood so there might be less options for meat and vegetables...",May V

As soon as you get into the gate, you will have to pass by their sales rep who keeps on explaining (per group of people or per family) the need for such items...and collects payment there. Thus, taking a lot of time just to pass that spot.  And when we're able to get in..just before they open the metal door inside, the gatekeeper will explain again the need for such items...and keeps on asking for anyone who wants the items...and collects payment (while we're all wearing their thick jacket...and yes, we're sweating inside) .

For the young ones and those who have no vertigo and heart problems can ride the Surfdance, rhe Star Frisbee and the Star Flyer to their hearts content. Only those people who are willing to accept G-forces and have a high tolerance for speed and high centrifugal motions can very well hold up to the thrill, the blood surge and excitement of inverted flight in these rides. However for the young ONCE who have now physical liabilities there are rides that are compatible to our advancing age called the slow rotating Ferris Wheel.

The great thing about this place is that it is within the city and is accessible by public transport. What we liked about our recent visit were the games (although we hardly won anything), the snow world and the trick eye place where you can tale some fun photos.Tips:1. If you are not good with games, you can save more money by just buying stuffed toys from the stalls2. If you will try out the winter / snow place, bring socks along because you will be asked to wear the shoes that they lend3. In the snow place, better bring your own winter clothes because the ones they have are filthy. Also bring your masks and gloves.

Upon redemption, they asked me to send the confirmation via email which I felt was time consuming and inefficient. Anyway, we were able to get through and had a fun day. You can bring food and drinks but there are plenty of stores inside and they are affordable. Try to arrive early (as soon as it opens) to avoid long lines especially on outdoor rides. They are strict about height restrictions as well.We tried Snow World and I had to pay additional 170 pesos per person. The pay includes a worn winter jacket which you have to run once you get out for other people to wear. They mask for Php20 and Gloves for Php60. They sell hot chocolate and coffee inside for Php30-45. It was very cold and the slide was fun. They don't allow guest to take pictures using their gadgets and pictures were worth Php100 per photo. They official photographers who will take pictures at specific areas. You can claim the photos after 1-2 hours.  The ice sculptures were big but werent very impressive. Some parts were melted already. The Php170 ticket allows you unlimited entry on the same day. They also have Adventure Zone. Its right beside Star City but you need to pay additional fees. Star City offers Php490 for ride all you can and Php 440 for three rides only. They dont sell tickets for individual rides.",Khalid D,"Tourist and Consumer grab. If they wanted to attract consumers, then charge just for the rides not the entry fee. Also, unlimited ride tickets costing almost the same price as a 3 ride ticket is absurd. And no individual ride tickets is ridiculous. To make things worse, lining up in the hot and humid heat for a ride is so unpleasant especially when the line ups are so long and fenced off with reinforced steel fences should an emergency occur.
