Danjugan Island,Cauayan,,Negros Occidental,,,,"Danjugan Island is a rainforest-covered island and rich marine sanctuary that can be reached after a 4-hour drive from Bacolod and a 30-minute boat ride from mainland Cauayan. The island has five lagoons, two of which you can explore by kayak. Since it’s a protected area, fishing is not allowed here, allowing marine life to explode in full color. The best part is, you don’t need to be a scuba diver to enjoy it, you can simply do so by snorkeling.","Danjugan Island is for me one of the best place I went in the Philippines. This Island is simply beautiful, It's quiet and you are inside the environment, that's what I like. If you are looking for a place to discover the nature of the Philippines and his beauty, it is the place to go",,,Beach Resort,,2950
