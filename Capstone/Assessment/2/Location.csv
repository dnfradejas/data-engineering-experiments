We had a great stay in this hotel, big rooms with sofa and working area, comfortable king sized bed, so comfortable anyone would want to stay and relax in the bed for hours!!

As I checked in I was asked for my ID so I gave them my passport. I asked for a higher floor and they gave it to me. Before I left the check in counter Leidan greeted me advance happy birthday. I asked him how he knew and he said he saw it in my passport.  Went out for dinner and when we got back to our room, a cake with a happy birthday was waiting there. I asked my hubby if he arranged something and he said no.  The next day we had breakfast at the hotel and everyone was available to assist. They exceeded our expectations.",BlessedToBoard,"My wife and I returned to the hotel for 2 two day stays recently. We booked a hotel car which at Pesos 1500.00 is excellent value for money.

We were in our room within 1 hour of landing. We had corner room 700 and 1600 upon our return. The room was very clean and well maintained. No different than 3 years ago when we stayed there.

The room is surprisingly small compared to the rooms of other hotels in the area but it does its job anyway. The bathtub/shower is not that friendly to people with ""flexibility"" issues. It's too high for me. The establishment should at least provide a step that can be used to get in to the shower.

Since I was also already in the city for a family emergency, I came to join him in the hotel.  And I must say that I was so disappointed, and can't help but compare with the hotel-residence I stayed in for 10 days prior.  To start with, the rate was about $50 more expensive (per day) for a room that was smaller than what I had in the residence.  When my husband came to discuss with the front desk about the rate they were charging the company, they even insisted that the 2nd breakfast was a charge more!

The room we originally booked was a studio type that had the weakest AC and worst bathroom I have ever experienced. We just came back from a long overseas trip and decided to give this one a shot because the hotel photos looked alright. When we got to the room it was so bad that we upgraded to a suite and that one was equally as bad. It had the smell of BO all over it, and I don't think they properly sanitized the room.  One of the worst things in the hotel is that they tell you cant leave the room until you get back your covid test results back. On top of that they didn't have food at the hotel, it was so inconvenient and also dreadful since we had to just stay in our room the entire time which was about 48 hours.

Btw, parking",ResTravels,We stayed there for two nights and I saw cockroaches. The experience is great although cleanliness is a big factor for me so I think they need to work on that.

The room is okay and spaceous enough for overnight stay of 5. 2. Food choices for breakfast buffet is few but delicious. 3.

No, I won't accept a new year's eve on the street with my 3 kids. Got surprised with the number of guests I saw upon check-in. Despite of the big crowd, we were able to check-in with ease. Kudos to frontdesk team for being professional and accommodating! The room is big and very comfortable. My kids enjoyed the pool and their breakfast although the variety  was not that much. The location is perfect! Since I only had 5 days to stay, we were close to the mall and areas which I needed to visit.  Cost is a bit high than others but the location will really give you a lot of savings. The only issue I encountered is for the room",Madz Mendez,"I booked the hotel without looking at reviews. I only read reviews here a few hours before the stay and was so worried. I'm a former hotelier and with a rate of just roughly over Php 2000 with free breakfast for 2, I wasn't really expecting so much.  Check-in was ok according to my husband who checked in ahead of me. There was a 2k deposit but we prepared for this. Anyway, I always expect hotels to have a security deposit in place. Goodie if there's none! The elevators are a bit slow so it's not for those who lack patience. But that's only during peak hours, like check-in and check out. We had to ride the elevator up then down because it keeps skipping our floor when going down. The building is old but our room was well-maintained and we had a wonderful view. It was big too.

Last, but certainly not the least, I love the rainshower head although the heater in B4705 was wonky; the hot water wasn't constant. It comes out hot then quickly cools off. I also love that the toilet has a bidet for thoroughly cleaning up yourself after pooping and the hotel provides you with dental hygiene kits, shampoo and conditioner. The bath towels were also soft and smelled good.   Breakfast at Cornerstone Cafe needs improvement on variety, taste and preparation. The scrambled egg on the chafing dish was too runny and bland. The ham and sausage on the menu the first time I stayed at BSA.",Dream566459,"If you are on a budget, think twice.

Cons: - Room was very bland and unappealing compared to advertised photos. Looks very basic like any motels in Manila - Room uses a window type aircon.

",Indy27,"I come to Megamall quite often as it is close to home and has most of the things I need at about a 10-15 minute walk away. Last visit was Jan. 10, 2019 (or yesterday as I am currently writing this). These are the major observations I've made:a.) When a lot of people come to Megamall to shop, you'll know as traffic becomes super congested and it is hard to get around even if the mall isn't exactly where you need to be. b.) Guards can be a little too pushy when they are inspecting bags to the point where one guard yanked my bag towards her just to poke the wooden stick they all hold into my bag. Guards have jobs to do but this doesn't give them the right to be that rude towards customers.c.) Most bathrooms often have one or two stalls that contain toilets which don't flush properly or don't contain enough toilet tissue.d.) Sales assistants in their department store do one of two things: Stand around talking to each other zoning out or hound their customers to get tags or codes off products or transaction numbers from receipts just so they can get commission that they don't deserve because they didn't actually do anything to be helpful. e.) With as many shops as Megamall has my boyfriend and I find that there are still some shops that Megamall does not have that we have seen in numerous other malls around the Metro. Some examples of stores we have searched for are: Digital Walker, Hobbes & Landes,  Baskin Robbins and Henry's Camera.Though there are many shops to go to and quite a few things to do here there is still a lot of room for improvement.",Ryan,"This shopping centre is a one stop shop that has everything to keep families entertained for hours.

I've got the Superior room which is pretty big for what I need. Clean, spacious room and they even bother placing usb charger besides the headboard which is nice.

On arrival, security helped me with my luggage and check in was a breeze. Check in was easy peasy and was guided to by room by a very cheerful porter. The Superior Room was very spacious and amenities sufficient for my 4 night stay. The daily buffet breakfast was great but the only thing is that the dining area is a little small for hotel of this size. Location wise, it's a short walk to most places. Robinson's Mall, Pedro Gil LRT, restaurants and pubs/bars.

I loved the fact they keep the walls in place and the historical significance of the fort. Seeing the cannons and the parade field were awesome. So many really cool things. I also enjoyed stopping at one of the businesses at the fort and getting one of the best halo halos (a great dessert) I have ever had.  I would highly recommend this location to be visited if you visit Manila.,Sarge57,"I loved the visit to this fort that is soaked in rich history. I enjoyed the inspirational Rizal shine, dungeons and the media naranja with the view of pasig river. The entrance fee was 75 pesos. The information centre was helpful.

Enjoy on your own though you won’t be disappointed,Hammer13,"Markers document the historical landmarks; it is well lit and safe, with free entertainment at different spots.      Fort Santiago, the main fortress of Intramuros established by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi on the site of the former wooden fort of Rajah Soliman in 1572, was burned during the siege of the Chinese Pirate Lin Fen (Limahong) in 1574. It was reconstructed with local tuff (adobe) from 1590 - 1593. It was the citadel of the armies of four foreign powers: Spain 🇪🇸 from 1571 to 1898; Great Britain 🇬🇧  from 1762 through 1764 during the Seven Year War; United States 🇺🇸 from 1898 to 1946; and the Empire of Japan 🇯🇵 from 1942 through 1945 during the Second World War. It was declared a National Shrine and a National Monument in 1951 and as a National Cultural Treasure in 2014.     The marker, Last Walk to Martyrdom Trail, a centennial freedom trail characterized by the shoe prints of Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal, memorializes the path he took to Bagumbayan from his cell in Fort Santiago in the early hours of December 30, 1896. It symbolizes the birth of the Filipino nation. The marker was unveiled on December 27, 1996 during the incumbency of His Excellency President Fidel V. Ramos.      Another point of interest for me was the Postigo de la Nuestra Señora de Soledad, a postern used as access from Fort Santiago to the Pasig River, from whence Lieutenant General Simon de Anda, leader of the Spanish Resistance against the British Occupation of Manila from 1762 through 1768 during the Seven Year War after a siege of Intramuros by the British Army.      A white stone cross marks the final resting place of approximately 600 Filipinos and Americans who were victims of atrocities including starvation and possibly suffocation by the Japanese Imperial Forces, during the last days of February 1945, who were found inside a nearby dungeon which had inner doors of massive iron bars and outer doors of iron plates on wood.",Pat r,"Visiting Fort Santiago is going through the different phases of Philippine history. The Spanish architecture of the buildings reminds us of Spain’s colonial rule, which heavily influenced the Philippine culture and psyche, making the country a unique country in Asia for having a lot of things in common with the Latin world and Europe. The prison cell and museum for Jose Rizal provided an educational tour about his life. His trial room, and the depiction of his footsteps from his prison cell going to where he would be executed enriched my understanding about his life. The museum about Intramuros, Manila’s walled city had the miniature models of the grand, gorgeous buildings which Manila had, before the bombings during World War II destroyed them all and they were never rebuilt. Much of Manila was destroyed during the war, but most of the colonial buildings were never rebuilt. The museum gave us a glimpse of Manila’s glorious past which was destroyed during the war.The place is great for students for their school trips, and also for tourists. There were lots of greenery, especially mango trees. The buildings and the gate are great for photos. The restrooms needed improvement though, but the entrance fee was cheap at 75 pesos. Overall, I love the place.",Luz C,"Worth seeing, in the Intramuros. Good views and interesting historically.  Not necessary to book a tour.

Well, just like the old times, you can see a lot of people here specifically students since there are many universities located inside this walled city. Will definitely come back. ",Iya Q.,"If you are visiting Manila, Intramuros is one of the places to go and explore. We were in the city for 24h and hotel staff recommended to visit, so we got a hotel-taxi (45mins from BCG to Intramuros, may take longer depending on traffic) and had an enjoyable afternoon. Intramuros is the old town and the building style is very much European. You can easily walk around the streets, there is little traffic, mostly bike-taxis that offer to take you on a guided tour. Since we needed some exercise we walked around the old fort and city walls (rather wear closed shoes than flip-flops, little bit dirty and there may be a rainpour). We started our walking tour at Fort Santiago and walked down to Rizal Park and back, visiting the Basilika Menore (a cathedral that had been destroyed 7 times through war or earthquakes and rebuild 8 times) and walked along the city walls. The streets are full of business, students and merchants, curio shops, street food and large governmental offices. We felt safe spending time there. Some of the bike-guides were a bit nagging but a friendly repeat-'No, thank you' did the job. Unfortunately we had no time to visit any of the museums but there is so much history to explore here (colonialism, WWII, post war era, ...). We spent 2.5h in Intramuros and it gave us a good impression of another part of this city, one that is not spick-and-span and glitzy with flashing lights but rather one that is full of friendly faces, local food and a lot of history.

A serious art connoisseur could easily spend two full days.  The building is massive with 3 floors.  The emphasis is on Philippine art and history.  Be sure to factor in the Manila traffic when going to the museum.  It took almost an hour to get to the museum from Makati with Grab (only a 5 mile drive!).

The other government-funded museums were also free of charge. The museum is a repository of species that can be found in the Philippines, but there are plenty of them. In every floor and section of the museum, you’ll find different kinds of ecosystems where those species thrive. There was also a life-size model of Lolong, probably the world’s largest saltwater crocodile that has ever lived or captured. There were few people when I visited and the building was spacious and had a cozy atmosphere. If you’re interested about species in the Philippines, it’s a great place to visit.  Some people mixes up this museum with the other museums. This museum is for appreciation of the different species and ecosystems in the Philippines. If you’re interested about Philippines’ ancient civilization and artifacts, then the National Museum would be the place to go; and for learning about the different ethnic groups in the Philippines, the Museum of Anthropology would be the place to visit.",Makoto,"Very impressed by all the exhibits. It is a nice blend of text and more interactive activities - although slightly more text than activities. The information given is a fitting balance of depth and breadth of topics.

The guards frequently walk around.Most importantly, it is all free of charge!",Charis,"I was waiting for my friend to come join me in Rizal park and I decided to go inside the museum while I waited for her. Best decision ever! It's new, it's clean and not so crowded. I went there around 10:45 am.

The restoration and use is good. The museum had very good collection of the exhibits.,foodcrawlph,"Our short trip was overall good however one of the staff was VERY RUDE. I took a video (which I thought was ok, I'm sorry) when we were about to leave, and this lady guard came at us with a very rude tone. It was an honest mistake, deleted the video & said sorry but she keeps on babbing. I thought maybe if it were a family or a parent, she would have act more polite.

A real park to enjoy!On some nights, you get a light music and water show for all ages.

Lots of families and people enjoying the park and especially the fountains that are lit up and dance to music ,Las Buganvillas,"I had read it's like Central Park but then in Manila. But it's far from that. Maybe they say because it's well known in Manila but to me just a moderate park, not very special. I like the parks in Intramuros way more.",Bernadine S,"gosh, considering it is a national treasure, why is it so tacky and not maintained?  Guess there is no money for that.",Willeke A,"It is a nice park in the morning, until probably 10 am. Then it becomes super crowded and stays like that during the day. There are a lot of people who try to sell you stuff, including buggy rides to the intramuros. Tell them no, because intramuros is definitely walkable and don't fall for their tricks. Just smile and say no thank you. Probably avoid at night, I mean it's full of beggars even in the day so I can really not imagine what occurs there at nighttime. I went to the Natural history museum there, it is definitely worth it! Not counting churches, its the cleanest place in Manila (the museum, not the park) :)",J Mesinger,We visited this park after early evening. Alot of families with children were around so its a great way to spend time for them!,Hana,We ended up in this park after visit the museum of anthropology and the museum of natural history.

We had the fried Lumpia with pork and shrimp, which was very good, the fresh lumpia and the lumpia gulay. The last one was good, but not as good as the others. All came with a different dipping sauce. This is part of a chain and we were happy with our choice. Opening hours follow mall hours, so check before going.

Probably because of worries about theft, Filipino supermarkets have not introduced self service checkouts. The cashier was very slow and did not have a male packer to assist her.  However the supermarket has a very good range.

This mall is complete from out favorite restaurant to my favorite massage parlor and shopping. ,Victorianlad,"The reason i am giving Robinsons Mall such a high rating over SM is because of its customer service. As a Canadian, the customer service was so much better than SM.More importantly, you can use your 11 pin foreign bank card password at Robinsons or any other restaurants and Bank of Manila card machine but you cant use it at SM and BDO card machines. SM kept on asking me for my bank cards but Canadians always use 11 pin password for privacy concerns. Robinsons is okay with 11 pins but SM is not. So SM sucks and Robinsons is the best. ",HHS,"Robinson Mall has been here for years. It has grown and expanded. It is easy to get lost in and come out a different entrance than where you came in. I use my GPS to get around.

Despite the heavy rain during the wedding ceremony, surroundings are safe and secured especially the parked cars outside the vicinity. Has a nice lobby for guest and a little reception area. The only thing that I can suggest to further improve accessibility and convenience is to put additional cemented flooring on parkings because of the mud and dirt from heavy rains.

It was ok but not as impressive looking as many I've seen in Philippines.  There was a wedding on so I could not to inside unfortunately.,bklynbubba,"I’ve been to many cathedrals worldwide and San Agustin is perhaps the most majestic and beautiful of them all. The church grounds also has a museum that features many impressive pieces of historical spiritual art.  The best way to visit the church is to buy a ticket to the museum and see both the church and museum on your visit.  Trust me, you will not want to visit just one.  You’ll need at least a few hours to see both.  I had absolute complete freedom to roam anywhere on the property including up to the magnificent organ room on the upper level of the church. This was probably my favorite site during my Manila trip even though I’m not religious. You’ll find endless beautiful historical religious artifacts and works of art throughout the church and museum.  Please remember this is still an active running church so please observe silence when visiting, especially in the church itself.",G2Kpauly,Beautiful architecture inside and out.

You should visit both the church and the museum on the same visit.  The museum is spread over the entire massive grounds over two floors.  Many of the pieces tell the story of the evolution Christianity in the Philippines.  You could easily spend at least a couple of hours in just the museum itself.  I spent a few hours on the entire property including the church.  There are two beautiful gardens on the property.  Be sure and look for the turtles in the inner garden fountain.  Don’t get too close to the fountain because they’ll swim underwater.  They appear to be shy and very aware of people.  ,Steven T,"The museum was a wealth of history that traced back to the Spanish landing in Philippines.  It was unfortunate that it was heavily damaged during WWII and many of the treasures were destroyed but the church and grounds were rebuilt.  What relics and important artifacts that were saved, salvaged or returned to the church were displayed in a number of different temperature controlled rooms.  A lot were lost.  Paintings of saints and retablos (altars) lined the walkways with windows that over looked the courtyard.The central garden courtyard was green and popular for group photos while the gardens in the back,  accessed through the gift shop, was more secluded and nice for a contemplative walk.The crypt was unique with no matching niches.  The famous painter, Juan Luna, was interred here.I recommend going to the second floor where the choir sits near the organ.  From that vantage point one could look down onto the main church floor and the altar.  The ornate ceiling was actually like a painting.  View was available even when the church was closed for a wedding.

Due to frequent disaster and war time marauders a lot is no longer here, but what is here is stunning. ",Arnold C,"Stopped here on a whim and we are glad we did.  Very big museum that went into great detail about St. Augustine, the monks, and the impact on the Philippines.  We have visited museums like this in Europe, but this was less crowded and more informative.  English was used throughout the museum.",Daniel D,"If you're into seeing religious relics, then this museum within the church complex is for you. The entrance fee is a bit higher compared to other attractions within Intramuros. The whole complex is air-conditioned, so it's a good opportunity to cool down after venturing on a sight-seeing tour in the area. It features antic collections of religious items, but the highlight for me is the view of the altar from the balcony.

We decided to spend Labor Day in ATC to enjoy some good food at one particular restaurant we frequently dine at, shopping and probably a movie. To our disappointment, there was no air conditioning, toilets were closed and no water for hand washing at the least. The gruelling heat which affected both clients and ales people made it impossible to enjoy the day. And the thought of utensils and and dishes not being properly prepared and cleaned finally lead us to the exit.

The mall is generally dark despite it having a courtyard- maybe it was the low ceilings?  The layout does not make any sense (the cinema is on the first floor with its lobby used as a passageway for one part of the mall to another- cinemas are usually on higher floors and at the corner so there is less noise). Security seemed to be an issue since there were beggars inside the mall. It was generally dingy as in poorly maintained and required cleaning.

We reserved the table thru a Female Manager call Tina /Dina, not pretty sure with the name. She was pretty helpful however today was her day to rest  So she endorsed us to another Malaysian Manager with surname of Kok/Kwok. Joan called the manager and of course Tina/Dina asked us to look for him, we do asked Joan to asked him. im not sure how a Manager should react when the guest called them but this Manager was really provided as bad impression as a MANAGER.He waljwd away when we still asking him questions as he was busy with other thing. We do not want to make an comment however it showed how awful and ugly a MANAGER as a leader who carriwd the name of the restaurant even the a hotel who react like this.He had definitly ruined the image.Food were not up to expectation, tastes were weird.No next time.",steve y,"NOBU HOTEL:Front Desk Check In was EXCELLENT, very courteous and welcoming.Rooms and Suites are well appointed and immaculately clean and sterilized to highest standards.Housekeeping are doing a great job in Covid times to restore guests confidence.Thank you to 'Maureen' a Front Desk Supervisor and her team for the continued warm welcome at Nobu.WAVE BAR & RESTUARANTA great way to spend either the day or evening looking over the hotel gardens and pools. The menu is more American Based and the Wave Burger, Chicken Inasal and Steak are delicious and recommended.Service at WAVE is consistently good and the staff are very accommodating to food requests. A special thank you to both 'Dave Narisma' and 'Ian Daniel' who are both well trained and friendly waiters who are fun and entertaining. ",Albert M,"I have been going to COD for several years and my first time to try WAVE.Excellent American style menu with reasonable prices for 5 star dinning. The Australian 10oz steak and WAVE house burger was very tasty and cooked to perfection.The Greek salad and Caesar salads were plentiful and good for sharing.We was served by “Gilbert” and “Louie-Rose” whom to date are the best servers and service that I have experienced in my several years of coming to COD, a real pleasure to have professional but at same time friendly service with no errors...It was reassuring to observe the strict hygiene and sanitizing standards was clearly in force and reassuring in these Covid times. Thank you WAVE for a very enjoyable evening. Clearly these servers are management potential or trainers.Mike(British)",Travel,- Front desk staff were very helpful and informative.  - Rooms were clean and comfortable.- I'm not a gambler but was entertained by the show in the casino.,coyg2019,Went with friends just to have that casino experience. Parking was ample though it’s across the venue. Security has thermal scanners so that’s good with the recent status of NCOV. Getting service is quite slow. We only got a service when one of us started winning so that can be improved.,Nelea Charisse T,City of Dreams is an 'integrated resort' that includes three 5 star hotels plus a wide range of retail and restaurants and other leisure and gaming availability all under one roof.,Rory James DOYLE,"City of Dreams is a complex of three hotels, casino, and numerous restaurants.  We stayed at all three hotels.  The Hyatt was the oldest of the three, the least expensive, and the most crowded.  We had a unattractive street and city view with a swampy parking lot below filled with strange milky looking water.  On the plus side there was a nice pool area, great shower, good air conditioning, comfortable double beds, lots of towels in the bathroom, and a night light.  Put your room card in the slot by the door to turn on the lights. We did not see complimentary water and the water price was hidden in the drawer.  There is no ice bucket or ice machine.  We ordered some ice from room service that came in a bowl.  Toiletries were in an ugly little box on counter.  They do offer a free shuttle to Mall of Asia that runs from 11:00 am until 2:00 am.  There was a small fruit platter with an apple, orange and pear.  No plate with knife and fork. We went online to book a room for an additional night though we just needed it for a few hours before a late flight.  We saw online that there was space available.  My husband went downstairs to book the room and was told to go back to his room and dial 0.  He did and was told to go downstairs.  Also because we booked the first room online through a third party (hotels.com) the Hyatt did not count our stay as part of their frequent visitor program.  Our second room was nicer and larger than the first with a garden view.  The lobby was extremely smoky and disorganized.  Casino is extremely busy Friday and Saturday nights. Luckily we met a very nice representative at the airport.  He was the best thing about the hotel.  He helped arrange our transport to and from the hotel and waited with us at the airport until we were safely aboard the shuttle.  Note of all three hotels at City of Dreams the Hyatt had the lowest airport transportation $50 US versus $80 US from Nobu.  Decent accommodations.  Ask for a garden view.",Kathleen H,"This buffet has it all. Seafood, Filipino food, casual food. Atmosphere is nice and quiet enough to have good conversations. ",Henry S,various food stores - local and international; plus nice shops and stores selling interesting items - trinkets to the pricey items like jewelry and time pieces,ShuKat,"This is amongst the CASINOS Newly established in Manila. The Casino is Average as compared to the others established about the same time and around the same area. The gaming facilities are limited, so are the floor space and the numbers of gaming tables and varities, as compared to the other Casinos. It is surprising , as the JV Owner is one of the KEY Casino operators in MACAU !!! The shops within is also not too exciting and quite limited. Not many eateries around the complex as well. Service standard can also be improved. Visit it for the sake of HAVE BEEN !!!",313globetrotter,Not a lot of selection for places to eat. Casino is okay. Limited shops due to the limited space. Free parking.,Travel Kings,"I came here January 2020 to meet up with local family. BEWARE this casino is ghetto, with people watching you & your machine. And the smoke is terrible. My aunt is elderly & handicapped. She was sitting in a machine where the entire row was empty. She lost all her money & was waiting for the rest of the group. Employees told her to get up and leave, and that those machines are for paying players. Uhhh...duhh she was playing but lost because all your machines suck! Will never return here. You should be ashamed!!!!",ed M,A very nice structure inside and out. Having a lot of entertainments like casino dreamplay and a lot of restaurants and cafe inside,@va17ess,"Went there for the casino and had our dinner there. The casino is two storey and huge. As I wasn't a smoker, I felt that the place was too smoky and left me with a headache. Drinks are all free, I will recommend the hot chocolate if you're feeling cold. Quite a number of people all trying their luck at the various tables, and even if you're not a gambler, you can people-watch which is rather interesting. A handful of restaurants there, and a food area where there are about 7 food trucks that food is priced cheaper than eating at the restaurants.",SephRB,I have played here several times.Nice placeBut there's alot of foreigners like Chinese playing and smoking.And I never win anything here. Unlike okada and solaire where I win. ,Bernice Sim,"We  had a pleasant stay in the City of Dreams. The hotel has a casino, a variety of choices to shop at and eat in, that you never need to leave its premises, despite it also being near to SM MOA. Room was clean, bed confortable. We had a few not-so-good experiences, but overall, it was pleasant.",Mark Evangelista PWD,"I have a few things to point out.  The brief stay was good and not so good in some aspects which I will write below and let you decide The GOOD:Hotel room, amenities and view - Great! Service - friendly and accommodating staff who assisted us during check-in; even gave my wife a bday cake to celebrate the occasionRestaurants - the food truck park was a hit with all of and offers you variety of food and drinks, some of our favorite dishes were available and allowed my wife and I to try a couple of new restaurantsPool area and gardens - quite nice to stroll and walk around, it was drizzling but I really liked the use of spaceThe NOT-SO-GOOD:- going to and from the food park to the hotel, you have to walk around the casino area where the smell of smoke was nauseating and I was actually surprised people were walking with small kids and even infants in strollers around this area.  Health hazard (funny that the NO SMOKING sign was quite visibly posted on the pillars around the casino floor :)- my son and I wanted to go for a swim, usually my son wears his board shorts and a dri-fit shirt which the pool attendants had to verify with me since it is quite fitting for my son who was on the chubby side that it could be mistaken for a rashguard, the material was almost similar - however, they only allow rashguard attire or barenaked for men.  Disappointed, my son and I just decided to forego the swim and walked back up to the room.  Take note of this to avoid disappointment- I was not satisfied with the number of food choices in the breakfast buffet.  The reason I did not gave this review a POOR rating, the staycation was still fun and quite memorable because of the people you spend it with.  All the rest are extra!",remicharlene,"You know, I want to go out of my way to say just how awesome this place is! My wife and I just got back from a two night trip and I can't say enough about the Resorts World Manila. Huge casino. Awesome slots. So many slots actually. Comparable to Las Vegas in quantity in that regard. But the best thing for me was the casino staff. I had a few drinks on my last night and was high fiving and cheering at the baccarrat tables and I wasnt obnoxious or anything, but I was loud and energetic. All the dealers were cool with me and therefore I tipped from time to time.The hotel security never once came over to tell me to keep it down and I mention this because there have been a lot of reviews suggesting that the casino security is heavy handed. ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. They were great. They let me have fun, win or lose. Also there are so many amazing restaurants both at the casino level and in the mall. You simply don't need to leave the place. I loved it. Kudos to the staff and management. Definitely this is my first choice for casino action in Asia. Why? Because it's so much fun. Thanks Resorts World. I will be back soon.",Mao M,"what a wonderful place to visit - from the excellent gardens and pool area to the restaurants and entertainment - such as the Entertainment complex with Virtual reality games and the Dreamworks interactive play area to the many restaurants, shops and huge casinos. plenty to do, plenty to enjoy. Just one issue and that is that smoking is permitted in the Casinos- very disappointing",gardenbear,"My wife and I stay here when we want to be close to the airport. As a Hyatt rewards program member, we have always been given a complimentary suite upgrade. The Hotel has a casino, shopping, restaurants, and you never need to leave. It's not on a main street so getting a taxi can sometimes be a problem if leaving at very early or late hours.",kalboHastings - prolific reviewer
 Paranaque,Tourist Site,Okada Manila Resort & Casino,"A US$2.4 billion development sprawled in a 44-hectare premium property at the heart of Manila’s fast-rising Entertainment City, Okada Manila sets the new gold standard for five-star luxury. Iconic in its grandeur and lavishly executed in every detail, it is unprecedented in its bold take on elegance and sophistication. As Manila Bay’s crown jewel, Okada Manila is the newest and grandest gaming and entertainment destination in Asia. From its sinfully sumptuous suites and villas, to its award-winning cuisine prepared by expert chefs, to the region’s first indoor beach club, to the prestige brands on offer at its retail glass corridor. And its stunning centerpiece: the grand musical fountain, which rivals other spectacular fountains in Dubai and Las Vegas. The fountain stands as a monument to Okada Manila’s grand vision of building what will perhaps become one of the wonders of the modern world. Breaking new ground with its many distinct innovations, Okada Manila expertly combines advanced technology, top-class amenities, environment-friendly architectural planning, and world-class entertainment options—topped with the kind of exemplary service that personifies a unique blend of Japanese hospitality and Filipino warmth. Okada Manila is the flagship development of Tiger Resort, Leisure and Entertainment, Inc., which in turn is a subsidiary of Japan’s Universal Entertainment Corporation (UEC), a world leader in the design and manufacture of gaming machines.Read more",Casinos,"New Seaside Drive Entertainment City, Paranaque, Luzon 1701 Philippines",0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"So I was staying at okada last night with my family when a guard harassed me, asked for my ID and everything. We're about to take a dinner but they disturbed us and held me in a secluded office where everybody were just a male security guards for more than an hour. They didn't allowed my boyfriend to escort me inside and the head of security looks like a boasting maniac. They accused me for room selling when my other account was just hacked by a scammer. I understand what they are saying but at least they should investigate first before saying that I will be banned in the premises. I'm going to sue that security and make sure everyone will pay. That is harassment.",Blessie A,This will be my best hotel experience.  Staff members were courteous... I was amazed by the huge jacuzzi inside the room.  The only thing i missed is the swimming pool because it was closed due to pandemic.  Looking forward to come back again!,Kriss R,"It was truly a relaxing momeny. I got a chance to experience world-class spa. I truly admire the ambiance because it was so grand, expensive and peaceful.",Ivaylo Ivanov,"We had such an amazing experience staying at this hotel. Antigen testing was smooth and we were able to check in right after getting the results. The staffs are all nice and greets you whenever they see you. Our Executive Suite is super nice, and the view is really amazing. It's really worth it! Breakfast is also good, and we had it in-room since buffet is closed, but still loved it, and it's safer! They also surprised us with an anniversary banner and cake which is soooo sweet. Thank you so much, Okada for this lovely experience. We'll definitely come back and recommend you to our friends!❤️❤️❤️",Elisa Fantillo,"With all of the COVID restrictions, my wife and I have not been able to take our 6-month-old son anywhere. We were very excited to learn that we could come to the Okada for a staycation! A lot of the restaurants and amenities are currently closed, including the fountain, but we still thoroughly enjoyed our stay!  From all of our inquiries before our stay to our arrival and throughout our stay, everything was wonderful.  We arrived to the incredibly helpful staff who valeted our car, took our luggage, and escorted us to the check-in desk. We completed COVID tests upon arrival, which were done very quickly.  We were then shown to our room, to which we found we were upgraded to an incredible suite, and our luggage arrived shortly after.  We had an issue with some of the lights in our unit not turning off the first night, but the problem was corrected the next day.  It was so nice to be able to walk around the property with our son.  Even sitting at the Starbucks felt like such a luxury!  The property did get crowded on Saturday and Sunday, with a lot of large events taking place and day guests coming to visit.  I will say that those guests do not require COVID tests, so it seems a little silly that you are required to have one only if you are spending the night.Nonetheless, our stay was wonderful and in particular, I would like to call out Timothy from the pool bar, Yussep from guest services, Rea from the concierge, Chris at the front door, and Jeffrey from guest services who all made our stay wonderful.  We hope to be back soon!",Ivaylo Ivanov,They’re good at surprises. Booked ahead of time for a 2-night stay to spend our first Valentine’s celebration as a married couple. All our booking requests which they confirmed and agreed to upon booking were ALL disregarded without any notice. Just found out that none were accommodated upon checking in to our room. What a surprise. I guess they’re living with they’re objective on making your experience memorable—in a bad way. Spent our first day just waiting for updates and follow ups. What a waste of time and money. So disappointing.  We are supposed to be relaxing now. but here I am writing a review about our bad experience on our day 1 at Okada.,Marga E,"I highly recommend this place. Exceptional service is the reason why I keep on coming back. From their front desk , room service and most especially the pool area. Would like to really commend Sarah and Menard from the pool area, very effective and efficient. They’re very polite and accommodating. Simply love this place. Kudos for having a great team.",Ivaylo Ivanov,Highly recommended to all family and friends that want to unwind and relax. We had a great experience because of the staff at Coral Wing Pool specially at the Pool Bar staff tim and sarah they keep us entertain and they are very accommodating they are serving different kinds of cocktails that will made your day and food is also excellent!!!! The safety protocols are also followed here.,Ben Heyman,"My mother in law got a complimentary stay here today and we are really amazed with all the hotel staff because you really feel their kindness! I forgot the name of the Front desk staff who assisted us but she was very kind and explained everything we would need to know without even asking first. I should know because I work in other Hotel. 😉 I want to commend especially those friendly staffs at the Pool Bar located at the swimming pool namely Timothy, He’s really nice and so approachable. He even offered us to take our beautiful photos there and He told us some good insights about the Hotel. Menard, Neil, Jothan and Paul are also nice and very accommodating! 👍🏻Everything in the Room is controlled by an IPad. From the Lightings, AC, TV, Map, Minibar, etc! This is really awesome experience for us! Plus the sanitation and cleanliness are also great! Overall our stay was really superb! 👍🏻😘Thank you, Okada Manila!❤️We should go back! 👍🏻☺️",Sia,"Okada Pool Bar has the amenities we are looking for, kid friendly and the staff are attentive to all our needs. Outstanding service (esp. Timothy) and the place is TOPS. We will soon be back. ",Ivaylo Ivanov,"My partner and I booked the Okada hotel for one night before our long haul flight the following day. Having travelled around for three weeks, we wanted a bit of luxury before returning to the UK; Okada did not deliver. Upon arrival we were surprised that our luggage was searched numerous times, but understood the need for security. We arrived at 5pm when our designated check-in was 3pm, to be advised our room was not yet ready. The receptionist began by saying we could use the spa or sit in the bar and wait. We were not offered any complementary treatments or even a drink, just simply told you will have to wait the room is not ready. After much back and forth we were told ten minutes to wait, which seemed slightly odd considering she had originally advised we go and get a spa treatment whilst we wait. The room itself was nice, however had a very strong smell of petrol fumes. We turned off the aircon unit but this made no difference. When we returned to the room and got into bed around midnight, I discovered a patch of blood on the sheet that had clearly not come from either of us. This explained why we were originally told the room was not ready, then it was suddenly ready within ten minutes. Quite clearly the bed sheets were not changed before our stay. We felt physically sick. This is utterly disgusting service from a '5*' hotel. We had to call house keeping to change the bed, and again we were not offered anything to compensate for such poor service. Would not recommend. ",Gel C,"I went to Okada. They did not let me enter with my backpack. I came from my layover flight and decided to go to casino to gamble. My backpack is a Gucci brand and it was 2000usd. I don't feel safe checking in my backpack, they want me to check in my backpack or else i cannot enter. I have my documents and many business credit cards and a small business laptop. I do not feel safe checking in my backpack. I want to carry it with me for peace of mind. It’s a small backpack. Why can't i enter? this is a very bad experience for me. I've been to many casino before, and this is the first time i cannot enter with my bag.",Sophie Emma,"Okada Manila, can be seen along coastal road.

Kudos!!! Thank you okada!!!,Ivaylo Ivanov,"Every casino in the world, from las vegas to atlantic city, to monte carlo, to macau, to Resort World Manila allows customers to carry their backpack. It's common sense.Only Okada does not allow it. I goto casino, I carry valueables in my backpack; passport, credit cards, medicine pills, glasses, cash, high denomination chips, cellphones, chargers.After going to security scanner xray machine, and nothing malicious found, I goto the casino floor, but the security says ""no backpack allowed"" The security guard wanted me to ""check-in"" my backpack. I said, why would I check in my backpack? I have all my valueable items that I carry with me at all times. He says that I have to put my items in my pockets. So while I play baccarat or slot machine, I have 2 big cellphones in my jeans. my passport id will bend. This is uncomfortable. Security guard says backpack is allowed only if u have bundles of cash.so now every time I goto Okada, I have bundles of cash, just so I can enter. The security must see that cash. He wants to see. This is awkard and privacy invasive. So now if you see a person with a backpack in Okada, it means theyre carrying hundreds of thousands. It makes them a target (to be followed to parking etc). Do u see whats wrong here? Why does Okada make such rule? whats the purpose? why don't you have a meeting and re evaluate your protocols.thank u",Carol O,"Just went to view the Dancing Fountains, and it was fantastic.It's amazing how those fountains swing in tune with Aerosmith's ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing . . .""I think they have these shows every Christmas Season (have to check this). Better bring a really good video camera, with a zoom lens.",Ivaylo Ivanov,"Sometimes, it's the best things in Life that are Free. That's the impression one can get watching the Fountain Show at Okada Manila.Okada Manila's welcoming ambiance is expressed in its Pink Colors - definitely elegant and could never be mistaken for tacky. The hotel's layout design is best appreciated as it draws visitors to its attractions (immediately the Fountain Show) rather than building a crowd in its lounge/ reception area which is common for most hotels.  Exiting the hotel as well offers the same revelation - no throng of guests waiting to exit out albeit seemingly slow valet services.",FellowTraveler796017,"As far as entertainment & fun is what you've been looking for...this is the place to be.

I’m 32 I could pass for 21 I felt like there’s a misconception that a young person like me doesn’t have that much money or they think I’m Filipino or white. As a dealer when I sat down was very nice prob my age was in shock I obv don’t look like the avg Asian as he said. He said I know your Asian but it’s like your white I never seen this before. Also the guards getting in were rude it was like they were told to try and give attitudes to people they feel don’t have money so they won’t come back. I swear changing into a nice button down expensive jeans i saw a difference. I carried a bag man purse guard looks in and my passport 5000 usd and 100,000 peso stack. Attitude changed. More things seem to confirm it when I go back as I’m staying at resorts world I was coming for poker game then would gamble. No one was in line to go through metal detectors and I stand there unzip my bag and instead of the swift hand upfront  and back not touching far out to see bulge and used stick. And she gave me this attitude out of nowhere and nudge me i only went inch but she check by back side again and it’s her angry face. Now I’m saved by a guard who saw my money previous day and she tells the guard to stop it’s ok and looks down smiling. I only game there cuz there was poker action which even the floors managers will tell you it was because of me regulars showed up. There is something in Filipino culture or the casino wants to keep a certain kind of person out as I didn’t want special treatment but so many rude  responses to simple questions. It might be they don’t realize they are not only in service industry but an industry where people are losing Money. This is a complaint as a whole not complaining about specific person etc. I will be returning and would love to play poker there but also take breaks and play 100,000 php at baccarat then go back as playing poker even though it’s raked out of principle I couldn’t lose money to people being rude.  I also would never complain about a person and have there job possibly in harm but what recourse does any employee from okada suggest I do if I’m getting these nasty vibes from floor men dealers. What is funny my personality is the type to go get 1million pesos and walk right in front of the guy that was rude to me. But I’m Las Vegas it’s easier with $20,000 usd then 1million pesos.  I wanted to end with some sarcasm and I don’t want anything don’t need anything but I’d like to hear from an employee because these casinos were built specifically for a certain race/culture and high rollers I know real high rollers and I didn’t see any I saw 10,000 peso max bet tables. I’ll stop im just upset because minus the interaction I like the layout over  Solaire besides there suites there casino is nothing special.’Okada was built great and I’d like to play there. Hopefully there’s a response with in 2 weeks. I fly in korean airlines Ny business if you wanna send a car? Kidding.",Ivaylo Ivanov

However, once you step foot in their grounds, they will, to the best of their ability, make you feel comfortable and welcomed despite what the pandemic has forged us to adapt with. While there may have been a lot of protocols to follow, I understand and I completely appreciate their efforts to do so—just to make everyone feel safe.At one point, I even broke my face shield and one of the staff gladly told me to go to the concierge and ask for an extra face shield. And, so I did. Fortunately, they had an extra and promptly gave a brand new face shield.Even before the pandemic, I was not a frequent visitor at Solaire.

Why? Because this has been my favourite hotel for the past 7 years. The moment Solaire has been established I and my partner has been with them since then. As a very regular and frequent guests, Solaire has been an extension of our home. I know its every corner from the valet parking staff to the concierge/bellboys, room attendants, security personnel, front desk officers of both towers-bay/sky, restaurant waiters/managers, cooks/chef in the fresh, even to every brand of soap and shampoo used and is currently used. All faces are familiar, even those transferred from one area to another, or even those promoted or suddenly gone. I can name names of workers who answers on every department & even those who work proudly or just working to finish the day.. I noticed too the months when its extra clean for probably Forbes is about to check. Familiar also with every menu from the menu book (even to its taste and how it is presented)and to specialties of every resto- waterside, yakumi, finestra etc. Ask me anything even to the performances of each employee, or if the room was turned down, to the paper, pencil and greeting letter at the table of each room by its VP, to the taste & price of every dish in the food court. So familiar even to the hotel's scents, bottled water taste, to brand of its pillows and if sauna is working or under repair.. If this is an exam, I will surely get a 100% grade.

Happy 2020 Solaire Team.",Paradise35141352471,"Last January 7 (between 5-7pm), I was shopping in the G/F at the Sky Tower of Solaire (building annex connected to Solaire Main Hotel) when suddenly I saw some management staff plus firemen carrying extinguishers rushing to the elevator. When I (with other shoppers/employers) was trying to access the elevator to go to parking, they blocked us off and said the elevators are temporarily not accessible. So naturally, I proceeded to the FIRE EXIT to make my way to 3/F, a security lady blocked me and asked me to stay in the G/F. Worried, I was asking security what is happening some would say-1. ""we cannot confirm""2. ""Secret""3. Fire broke out in one of the floors4. "" stay inside foe your safety"" FIRE?!?!?! If it did, then WHY DID I NOT HEAR any fire alarms? And Why are we not allowed to access the FIRE EXIT???After 30mins of waiting within the lobby area. Security was directing us to go outside, at the docking area of the Sky Tower Building. Again, I still dont hear fire alarms.Slowly, I see building employees (of companies renting in the SKY Tower as all would have building IDs. BUT notable, i did not see hotel and casino guests being evacuated. You can see in the video below majority would have building IDs.While outside, they just asked us to wait. NO security marshalls and no building staff announcing any general advise regarding the matter. And no directions or lines being instructed for us to follow, which I am expecting from a 5 star hotel building. I saw some young folks who are trying to video the moment and I security swarming towards them asking videos to be deleted. They were even shouting and threatening one yound lady that theyd bring her to security office and BAN HER in Solaire hotel and casino.Then firetrucks begin to arrive. Hmmm and they still wont divulge what is happening?!?!?Thoughts on this-1. If THIS WERE a fire drill. Why wasnt there an alarm triggered? Why was evacuation being selective? And if it were a fire drill, sorry to say but super bad handling.2. If there was really fire? Even small and on one floor only, why wasnt there any alarms triggered to the WHOLE BUILDING3. What if it worsened? Is that only time you will trigger the alarm4. Why were we not ALLOWED to use FIRE EXITShortly afrer 7pm, they allowed us to go out. Sharing some pics below",Jay A

We were offered another room we asked to see the room before vacating but was told this was not possible we decided to move upon relocating to room 411 we found the room to be a smoking room the sliding bolt on the door was not working the safe was not working the door lock to the balcony door not working. We had no alternative other than to move back with the cockroaches.

Everything was hassle free and Randel was exceptionally helpful.,jerome bayawa,"Every OFW can agree that going home to your family during the troubling times of pandemic is very time-consuming and stressful. With that being said, I cannot express how great the customer service is in Savoy Hotel Manila. As soon as I arrived, I was welcomed by an outstanding room. Cleanliness is one of the things we look forward to when staying in hotels, especially these days. It's obvious that everything was thoroughly cleaned, scrubbed, and disinfected to protect the health of staying guests.   The staff catered to all of my needs. I would like to commend Jerome de Pio, Zeke, and Aubrey for providing me quality customer service. Once the pandemic is over, I would gladly bring my family here for them to experience what Hotel Savoy Manila can offer.

He was so kind and warm to our needs. 10 days seem so long but when u spend it with the right people, its all so worth it!!!",angelyn125,Probably needs to train staff in guest etiquette.

Someday, for sure i will choose to stay in this hotel again. The only problem, actually not a big one :) is the repeatedly serving the same kind of meals all day ( I’m sorry maybe that’s their protocol for the quarantine peeps) but i must say that they are great because at least they’re made a way and tried their best to satisfy my request and stay there.

We booked this hotel for the convenience of not going home wet from Hydro Manila. They have a parling for my motorcycle and some space for 2-3 cars in front of the hotel. They have a nice lobby and elevator.  Room is okay although it's not that big. They have free amenities such as towels and toiletries.  They also have available foods for room service but not available for room charge so you have to pay as soon as it is delivered.  Its just few minutes away from MOA.  If you are planning to go there by taxi or grab,  it's better to take a 5-8 mins walk accross the footbridge rather than to ride a cab in front of the hotel and have a U-turn in Magallanes.  The staffs in the frontdesk are not so friendly and",Tin Tin,"The hotel is just 3.5km from the airport and is conveniently access by grab taxis.  Although if you are traveling with private car just ensure that you call the receptionist to arrange a parking for you. The hotel itself has a very small parking space.

We booked the twin /standard double room with private toilet and shower thru agoda. There are toiletries & Clean towels as well.  Also, we had our breakfast in their small restaurant downstairs.

We booked the tickets online as per experience, its always the quickest and convenient way. Well, its the exact opposite here! If you book a ticket on line, you will have to print the voucher, and go to their ticket station to still get the actual ticket. What's worst is that, the security team here looks like they dont know what they're doing. There are 2 counters with multiple lines!! Online purchase of tickets will also cost you more!! They charge 100 pesos per ticket purchased online for convenince fee to undergo their inconvenient process!!! It was my first time to watch here and will be my last. The seating areangement also doesnt have leg room! If you book a seat at the middle of the row, the only way to get to your seat without bumping another person is by flying!

Was able to shop quickly before I left for my flight.,Mr Prinz,You can find luxury goods here... enjoyed the event that was currently in the mall center that time. we had good food by barcino's and dessert at crisostomo's. ,Fred,"We were impressed at the huge complex built here in Newport City so close to Manila International Airport. With the Runway Manila walkway opened the casino complex is only a 20 minute walk from your plàne. If that is too much to walk there is a complimentary shuttle that runs 24/7 from the runway terminus. On the Runway there is a Resorts Casino booth and it is there you should make your first stop. The friendly employees will copy your passport picture onto your loyalty card which they will give you right then and there along with 500 pp in free play and a free gift ( some casino swag). With the loyalty card you can also get 300 pp every year on your birthday. The casino complex is mega with a hotel, several restaurants, a shopping mall, a coffee shop and a bar.the main casino is at ground level but there are more gaming areas upstairs especially high roller rooms. No photography allowed inside the casino, the pictures we took were at the entrance and the Chinese New Years decorations in the casino. The casino is mostly (80%) geared to Chinese clientele. There are table games we have never seen in the States but from what we heard you stand a better chance to win. The slot machines were not too tight. No longer free cocktails; don't know if soft drinks are still free. While we were there no cocktail waitress approached us.Therw was a large bar in the middle of the room. We were told there is nightly free live entertainment. Regretfully no dance floor. Rest rooms were spotless but only one location and that is next to the Cage.  The casino appeared clean and well ventilated. Did not appear to be too smokey. The furnishings may be a bit dated. We are used to American casinos with dim lighting so this one with the bright ceiling lights was a bit off putting at first. Perhaps this is how the Chinese gamblers prefer. All throughout the casino employees are extremely friendly. This extends to the security guards",MountaineerLu,"The mall is like a city within a city.....lots of hotels, designer shops and excellent restaurants to choose from.

Newport City houses several hotels which are just across the road from the airport, and offers excellent accommodation especially for those who want to avoid traffic jams on their way to the airport. The hotel would just be a few minutes walk to the airport. The restaurants at Terminal 3 offers more affordable meals compared to the restaurants at Newport City. If you stay at any of the hotels at Newport City and you prefer more affordable meals, you can leisurely pass through the pedestrian bridge and get a meal at one of the restos at NAIA Terminal 3. ",Makoto,"Whoever thought of putting in this pedestrian short cut from Newport City to Terminal 3 of Manila Airport was a genius. It opened up that development to airport traffic as well as opening up all the airport eateries on level 4 to people in Newport. The main reason was to get traffic to the casinos there especially Resorts World and it works. There is a booth halfway across the bridge where you can sign up for Resorts World loyalty program. The pedestrian walkway is air conditioned, there are moving walkways and golf carts to take you across upon request no charge, no tip expected but gladly accepted.Two sets of security checkpoints coming from Newport so you feel safe. There are restrooms, good signs and it is well lit. Perhaps one could have preferred more subdued mood lighting at night for tired travelers but that is not a major consideration. There are elevators on both ends and luggage carts are available at no charge. At the Newport side there is a plethora of shuttle busses available (free) to take passengers to the hotels, restaurants and casinos there. They run 24 hours a day and are free. Unless you have a large amount of luggage most of the destinations bin Newport can be walked to in less than 10-15 minutes. The walk is pleasant and the neighborhood very safe.

Only take advantage from tourists by Jack up the price.,Hawaii tourists,"I always like to visit a city’s public food markets when I visit a new city.  I read about Manila’s seafood market called Dampa and knew I just had to pay a visit.  It is a wonderful display of just about any seafood possible bordered by multiple restaurants waiting to cook it for you.  Everything is ultra fresh, most of it is still alive.  The procedure is you first choose your seafood from any of the numerous wet stalls and then choose which restaurant you want to cook it for you.  You really can’t get fresher than this set up.  This would be a must visit for any seafood lover visiting Manila.  Anthony Bourdain paid a visit here to try the freshest seafood in the Philippines.  Even if you’re not a seafood lover and don’t intend to dine here it is still a very interesting place to visit with many great photographic opportunities.  Most of the vendors are extremely proud of their displays and welcome photos.  ",Steven T,"Seaside Dampa is a large fish market where you can buy your seafood and have them cook (for a fee) at adjacent restaurants. Seafood is absolutely fresh, but also comes very expensive so be prepared to spend at least USD 40-60 per person, much more if you chose pricey items like lobsters or sea mantis.",ochassot,"Cravings were satisfied but got shocked as our pockets got empty!We did not go to the market and buy our own, we asked them to do it for us. A whopping Php 2,500 for two persons. No doubt they served good food, we had a kilo of crab, half kilo of shrimp and clams for soup.Though they were plenty -- I still find it pricey! The ambience also has to be improved so they can attract more customers.",Marifi M,"Food is good  that is our 2nd time, carefull lang kau sa pag order becoz sa menu nila akala mo cheap yong mga price kc ang nakasulat lang doon yong price ng service charge ng paluto kaya you must ask the waiter para hindi ka magulat sa bills mo",Bhang,"The food is great, but this place was so Expensive. We bought seafood outside the restaurants. We are super  suprise when we knew the price. Oh my God, we buy worth 2800 seafood and we pay 800 for the cooking. We are only 3 who will eat that foodCrabs: 1400 per kiloSquid: 1200 per kiloShrimp:1300 per kiloAnd we buy fish I forgot the name worth 500 per kilo. P.s: that is not yet cooked",Joy Lirazan,Food looks good but please beware of so many unscrupulous restaurants there (which are mostly owned by mainland China men operating business in the area). Menue price is for cooking charge but their actual price of meat / seafood are quite exorbitant. Ambiance is mostly targeted towards Chinese foreigners who frequent the area and cost is no object to them.,yujioka,"We came here expecting to have a good and fresh seafood feast. We went to a place that appears to be a Chinese restaurant but the owner/in charge was not involved with the customers at all. Only the locals(wait staff) where talking to us, promising us 1kg per dish (we didn’t havetime to buy it ourselves as we were already really hungry—because traffic!) with 350php cooking fee per dish (a bit steep than usual but again, hungry). The dishes came and we dug in straight away, of course. Halfway our dinner, one of my friends mentioned that the crabs looked really “empty”, then we noticed the prawns that looked less than a kilo. The sizzling squid was the same. We asked for a breakdown of the bill and realised that they have charged us way more than the amount of food (based on weight). When questioned, that’s when their demeanour changed. They were defensive, changed their stories (700gm per dish apparently, and not 1kg as previously agreed) and threatened to call the cops. We challenged them to please make sure the police gets involved to clear things up. Of course, no police came. In the end, we had to go to the market to check the prices and we paid them according to that price (like they initially promised us) but only for 500gms, not per kilo (because clearly, it wasn't a kilo). The initial bill was almost 7,000Php but we only paid 5,000php after we calculated what we think is fair and just. No one wants to talk to us anymore (the wait staff left the premises and the Chines “owner” doesn’t seem to care) so we left the money on the table and left. So never again in that horrible, horrible place. That was an expensive lesson learned.On the lighter side, Dampa in Alabang is apparently the better one with clear prices and dishes delivered as expected. We will be trying it out next year, so fingers crossed, it will be a total opposite experience and we can’t wait! We’re not giving up on dampa, not yet. 😉",Eric Uy,"Had a great time browsing around the market stalls to check on the wide variety of seafood available.

The previous 3 visits were ok that's why it became a fave restaurant for me. But Last night, was TERRIBLE! I bought 1 1/2 kgs of squid, 1 1/2 kgs of tahong /mussels .I know the QUANTITY of what I bought when it gets cooked. BUT when the waiter served our food, It was NOT AS EXPECTED, our squid in oyster sauce cut in small pieces was just 1 plate. steamed oysters and baked tahong  were just a few pieces  on 2 plates and when I asked the waiter about it he just said ""yan na yun"" !!!!!!! they LESSENED (BINAWASAN) THE QUANTITY OF FOOD I bought to be cooked. Well that is what I call another form of stealing. DO NOT EAT IN THIS RESTAURANT . if you do not want your food lessened when it gets served to you. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!",anythingpinoy,"Dampa or shanty is located near Manila bay seaside with a fresh seafood market and restaurants who will cook the seafood you purchase from the market.  After picking your choice of restaurant and type of recipe they cook the food and served at your table. JThe food is so fresh and sweet and we chose traditional Filipino recipes such as fresh lato (seaweed), sinigang na isda sa miso, adobong pusit was so tasty, steamed alimango (crab). And the best part is that the prices are reasonableI. Make sure you haggle when buying your seafood.  Oh an grab a fresh coconut and enjoy the coconut water as well.

Once you have what you want you pick the restaurant to cook it again check the prices before you decide. We went to the super wok ( about half way down the lane way) as it was really busy and a great price. I dont think you can go wrong with a restaurant filled with locals. We got our prawns cooked in garlic butter and our crab in chilli. A must eat is the garlic rice.   ",Michael San Diego,"If you want great seafood, this place is where you wanna be. Pricy but you’ll love their sweet chili crab and buttered prawns. It was amazing! We loved it ❤️",nicknox83,"This is what you do to get the most out of this place.....specially the tourists...tip 1)  Buy your seafood inside the market first...just ask for the best price..don't be intimidated...there are stalls alongside the road but there are more stalls in the back..probably with better prices..2) pick your restaurant...in my experience the best restaurants in that area are the big ones in the corner...the big chinese restaurants...if you don't like to go to the market or you are pressed for time you can just order from their menus...but their prices are probably double vs buying your own supply...3)when i go there i just usually buy crab and shrimp and maybe fish or scallop...i then have it cooked maybe butter garlic...sweet chili sauce...or salted fish style...it used to cost 300 per kilo for the salted fish style... i then order the rice, drinks and the soup from the restaurant itself...the last time i went we spent about 3000 for two people...4) do not go with the people there trying to get customers...the big restaurants usually do not have to do this...although if you're always there you can try the smaller ones..since they probably charge less...these are the ones patronized by the local customers who do not want any fancy cooking...5) the cooking price is by kilos...usually a minimum of one kilo...if you don't want seafood there are also meat and poultry at the market in the back...as well as vegetables..but this place specializes in seafood so there might be less options for meat and vegetables...",May V

They usually have fireworks every weekend also.,shapiro360,"I usually bring my visitors here, and we take pictures and stroll by the boardwalk, however this was the first time that we smelled sewage! Especially by the Conrad junction, it was horrible...",Ryan A,The bay Area park is maintained very neat and clean. Lot of Amusement. Good place to spend your time with Family and Children. ,Uday,A lot of rides to choose from and there are lots of restaurants around so you will not run out of options once your hunger sets in.,Melissa,"There isnt much down here for amusements.  However it is a great place to watch the sunset, heaps of places to get something to eat and people watch",Cristy Y,Awesome place! Varied activities are available both for the young and old. Food choices are also varied. Their play areas are interesting.,Anthony S,Coney Island New York and Santa Cruz move over for this seaside amusement park.  Adjacent to the Mall of America and with sweeping views odf the Pacific Ocean.,Igraine Lynnil Latumbo,"You have to like this place, specially when the weather is nice. After all, what not to like? Forget the games,, you have the ocean, you have a great number of restaurants, and you have Mall of Asia (a huge mall) just across the street.Don’t waste your time reading about it and just go there and enjoy your life..Peace.",Arnold C,"This is adjacent to the Mall of Asia, it is a great spot to watch the sunset.Get there early because there are long lines as far as the eye can see of people sitting on the wall waiting for the sunset.It's romantic. But be very cautious about the online scams by Filipina who make someone think that they are interested and after purchasing the plane tickets and reserving hotels, they will abandon you.Last time that I was in Manila a Filipina was arrested for fraud. It's not just the pickpockets but the online scams with foreigners too.Other scams are that a Filipina want to take a trip making the foreigners think they will be in a relationship but end communication after the girl gets her trip.They fabricate, alter, and falsify the truth. So be careful.",MuneerAltraiki,"Nice to walk along the bay here, no access to the sea. Kids enjoy the rides and there are some good places to grab something to eat. Did not try the ferris wheel but looks worth it. Needs renovation and a bit of TLC in some areas. This place worth a look if you are around the Mall of Asia area.",Alejandro O,A nice place to spend an early evening with the family. The ocean breeze makes it cool and easy to stroll leisurely during summer nights. There’s also a lot of restaurants along Seaside blvd.,HahnTravels,We went when and got caught in rain and wind while at the top of a huge faris wheel but we got to see Manila bay and it was gorgeous!  ,NDGM90,nice having here with my siblings.. riding in a rides ambiance and also nature air flows in my body makes me fell im totally having my summer vacation,Taylor S,"It is unique place to have a quality time with family, enjoy the Manila view especially sunset, some few rides enough to satisfy the urge of rides.

 Pasay,Tourist Site,Upside Down Museum,"Upside Down Museum is the newest craze in Mega Manila /Philippines. It features a massive upside down house - complete from Living room, dining,kitchen,bedroom,office and bathroom. It also features a real steel bridge with real SUVs(cars) - all upside down. It also features illusions that are never before seen in the Philippines.

The mueseum staff very helpful and helps you to take great pictures. One of good options in Manila to spend time.,Milind Goel,the place is small just good enough for the picture taking. They said birthday celebrant will be given free admission but there's an exemption to the rules and it's a little disappointing because when we are already in the place they said I have to pay full amount. even the discount was not given. over all the place is good and its really fun for picture taking,Kandy G,"I have visited the Upside Down Museum twice, in August and November 2019. This is not an especially huge attraction, but there are a good couple of dozen photo ops and installations to check out, all on one floor. The staff are also on hand to take photos at some of the more popular spots and I found them to be very helpful.There was a school group there when we arrived the first time so it was a bit crowded, but the second time we visited was at opening time on a Sunday and the whole place was virtually empty.Note that this attraction is tucked away down a gravel road and not really walkable from anywhere in the heat. You’ll need transport to and from.They provide lockers for your bags and in our case, the staff kindly stored our oversized suitcases in their office for no extra charge. Nice! It costs 450 pesos to get in, and they are open from 11 until 9 (closed on Mondays).",Saul_True,"Expected a lot from the price of the entrance fee (450php, cash only). Needs a little bit of maintenance. Toilets are not well-maintained. We couldn't use any of the 4 cubicles.Okay experience, but wouldn't comeback. ",Camille,"My friends from Australia paid me a visit on their way to a vacation in some of our tourist spots. I brought them to this museum for an extraordinary session of fun and amusement. I was not mistaken. We spend more than two hours in this unique house of entertainment. Those hours of joy, coupled with unsolicited laughing and picture taking moments will linger on for years to come.",ynadqnor,"The space is a lot smaller than what I expected, and some of the props are broken, but it's still really fun and worth a visit. The staff is there to take photos for you if you want, and they know how to suggest some really interesting poses.",Fleixer,"Nice and fun place to take great photos here. Always remember to hire a guide. They guide you best to take a proper shots. We had great fun there. Tickets are 450P per person. Ensure to wear easy clothes as you are required to bend, lie down and stretch etc. ",SamirArora,"Pros: a handful of opportunities to take some fun photos, staff was available to help at a few stations and offer suggestions on how to take pics, got a free ticket because it was bday month Cons: not much to do or see, aircon was barely working, kinda pricey for what you get even if 1 of our 5 tix was free! We were in and out in 30 min. Recommendations: take a pass on this and go to dessert museum or art in island, which offered more for the price Note: credit cards not accepted, peso only",Theresa C,Staffs were friendly and willing to take pictures for you. A lot of scenes for picture taking too. They just need to clean the toilet and bathtub part because it was so dirty. We didnt get to have a photo there because of that. ,Wonderlust,"Thrilling is a word to express our experience here.  Home Furnitures, fixtures, appliances, and gadgets are invertedly fixed at the ceiling and you are allowed to pose for a picture-shot which is then inverted on the screen shot to make it appear you yourself is hanging upside down. I would advise to ask help from the staff because they know exactly the right pose to make a perfectly funny shot. Guaranteed “LIKES” on FB.",bobiguzman,"1. Ticket is quite pricey (450 pesos) per ticket for a small museum. You can probably finish the whole thing including taking photos in about 30 minutes.2. There are staff there to help you take solo or group photos which is good.3. It's definitely interesting to see things being upside down. I felt like I was in the movie Inception.4. The museum is quite hidden. From the main road, you gotta go into a mini driveway that's filled with rocks and bumps. Don't expect to see the museum from the main road unless you got binoculars or something.OVERALL: It's worth checking out but I wouldn't return.",Gelai j,"The place is located in Pasay City , its accessable, however the Road/ street going inside need to be flattened.Tickets are reasonable for adults 450 php but for kids at least 7 yrs old should get a discount.Great place , however there are lots of busted lights that make pictures a little dull unlike When all are lighten up, the photos look so stunning.Staffs were quite helpful and assisting .",jchow123,"Where in the world could you see a museum where almost all of its contents are “Upside Down”?  What is up and what is down is NOT properly defined and all objects, articles, items and whatchamacallit are NOT in their normal upright position. There is a place in the CCP Complex called Upside Down Museum where every item, every object whether a car or a table or what-have-you is in a topsy-turvy condition. The illusion  created is unbelievable. And surprise of all surprises, the result of the photo shoot is totally unexpected. One thing is for sure, the experience is something hilarious, funny and totally enjoyable. This is the place where you can die laughing. My family and I totally enjoyed every moment of the photo session.",Alvs,The staff only helps groups of people. I asked for a guide multiple times and received no assistance with photos. Save your money and skip this exhibit!,ynadqnor,"Had such a hilarious time at this little hidden gem!  Perfect for our photo obsessed society.  It's essentially a warehouse with a bunch of built in vignettes you can pose in and it looks like the space is upside down.  The staff is super helpful and hilarious as often you'll need to ask them ""how should i pose?"" and they will demonstrate and take your photo. I was laughing the entire time.  Definitely a must see if you enjoy being goofy.  ",Janelle J,Taking pictures here is quite a challenge as you have to do those eccentric poses like stretching your legs and arms for you to look like your upside down in a certain place but then it’s really fun.  ,jenandallthethings,Absolutely crazy place to have fun with friends!! Was there with my colleagues and we had so much fun taking pictures there. Great place for team-building I believe. The staff helped to take pics and explained how to do it on our own. ,Weng845,I and my fiancé had a very fun experience when we went here. All the pictures that we had in the museum looks so convincing that we’re actually upside down!! ,28Lizavetik,Nice place but the entrance fee is too high for what you get. Entrance fee is 450 peso. Inside the staff is very friendly and they are helping you with taken nice pictures and place you in the right position for that picture. Not a bad place to visit.,Greg C,"Entrance fee is 450 at all ages. Only infant is free. The area is small, once you enter the museum you can see all of it. If not much people, in an hour you can take photos in every sectionHelpful staff are there to help take photos- right angle and pose. Don't forget to give some tip.",Ativoo

When she stayed in the hotel, she complimented how nice and clean the room is. They also helped her to process her permit to entry in Baguio and was kind enough to book for a Grab (special thanks to Ms. Angela Buenaventura!).

With the slow and unstable internet at the hotel Lobby, you'd be discoùraged to use Agoda.com or any other hotel booking app to get a fairly affordable room at this hotel. I use agoda most of the time because the room rates at Privato Ortigas are too high for their measly facilities and service!

The place is made for no frills, business stays - not for any romantic or relaxing getaway. This should come as a fair warning to couples. Bathroom is bare, with minimal toiletries. Facilities are so so and food at their restaurant is passable, while the ambiance is very businesslike.  What was irksome during our stay were several inconveniences which could have been handled better by management. Firstly, 1 out of only 2 elevators were out of service.

I recommend this place, I went there 2x!",iloveACE,We got it as package for our stay at the hotel so it’s a plus on the points for good value for money! We were not disappointed though we find it too crowded. My parents enjoyed their first time experience on water spa. Good staycation place,star4virgin,"We stayed here for a night just to experience their waterspa. The room was okay, big enough for 2 ax. The breakfast was just a normal hotel buffet, nothing special.

Super relaxing!!!!

From the staff of the spa up to the crew of their international buffet restaurant, i have nothing to say but ""great service!""",Wolfjohanna,Ace Water Spa is our go to place if we cannot go to the beach and chill. We've been here many times because it calms our senses and it gives our body the much deserve break. We usually buy vouchers thru Metrodeal. Guaranteed worth the price! 💯,iloveACE,"I LOVE THE QC AVE BRANCH. The Pasig branch is great coz it's got the hotel but it's crowded on weekends.Also, the last time we went there using my Metrodeal, everything is so hectic and disorganized at the reception that I gave 3 vouchers and paid for my kid at 300 pesos. I got so confused, I should have only given 2 vouchers for me and my husband then paid 300 for our kid. I even remember telling the lady there that there's only 3 of us but I guess she didn't bother coz she's also dazed and confused with the many people.

They have a huge advertisements promo but its subject for availability of the room which is the same as useless.. i will never return again and never recommend for anyone.

It was night time when we came from Pangasinan by bus and we really had no reservations in any hotel near Cubao so we tried to find a hotel where we can stay for one night.  We entered the hotel to do further inquiries we noticed that the receptionist is not quite very welcoming and not smiling at all.  When we approached the receptionist in this hotel to ask if they have any available rooms she said they only have one available room which is the suite room for 4000+ PHP per night.

They can be reached easily by public transport and if you bring your car, basement parking is readily available. The rooms are quite cheap as they offer upfront discount of 50% when you book through them (I highly suggest booking through Agoda or Trivago -- way much cheaper). The hotel is clean and the lobby is cool and organized. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Most of the bookings they offer have free breakfast.

The Room -  The room was plain but expected unfortunately the entire room had a massive stench of urine permeating throughout the place and we tried to get rid of it with perfume and spray; we called the hotel and the cleaning person tried to clean it but also agreed that the smell was unbearable.  Nothing had a lasting effect.   The cleaning person indicated it was a problem with drains.  Requests for a room change were met with ""sorry ma'am no rooms left""...  The cleaner also made the ridiculous suggestion that we leave the window open with the air con on as an alternative.

Be prepared that there are NO windows in some rooms, due to the dark wall painting and absence of windows you fell staying in a basement. Breakfast is totally not for European taste: fat black sausages, fried creppy fish, rice, weird soup. The only eatable is omlet, no tea, only coffee.

Over the course if my two days stay I see them running up the wall of the room and inside the bathroom wall and floor. Needless to say I killed them all. On my last night when I needed to pee and lift the toilet seat I saw at least 7-8 baby roaches running under the toilet seat. I did not use the toilet after that.

But we were disappointed in our recent stay. It was not maintaned properly. We were placed in a deluxe room with a very noisy aircon, and so we asked to be moved to another room. The staff are helpful and courteous, they moved us to another room - aircon is not too noisy but it didnt cool the room that much, maybe because its summer and its too hot. The restroom had a foul smell and the exhaust is not working. I would say they are overpriced, you can look for another hotel that is not far from the price and more comfortable.",cha_jenine,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data,No Data

He is very inefficient, and had this urgency to check and play in his mobile while he is answering my queries, and I feel like I disturb him in whatever it is he’s doing. He said he cannot reach my house parent while I WAS ABLE TO REACH HIM THE FIRST TIME I CALL.

If I were rich, I'd choose to stay here for a loooong long time. They have a 3-in-1 shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel so you don't have to buy those separately if it's okay for you to use other skincare products.

The 3-dimensional paintings give one a feeling of being one with it.  It allows you  to interact with it and enjoy the  exciting experience. One should know how to do it.  It is also an experience of knowing the special landmarks of other countries.  It's an expereince how to be a child again. :-),Jane V,Explore your creativity on all the pictures you can capture with their backgrounds and enjoy all the amazing things you can do inside the vicinity,milo_dapilos,"This was the second time I've gone to art in island, but this time with my nephew. Looking at the exhibit, even after 3 years, it is very much the same with some parts showing some wear, but not on a lot of exhibits/paintings.There is a new 'wing' but i'd rather call it a hallway and room. It has a separate ticket price but for the novelty, it was worth the experience just once. But this new area needs a good night mode camera/sensor.Overall, it was an enjoyable experience since my nephew had a lot of fun.But I don't see a reason to come back again as it is more of the same.Even the hourly light show (5 to 10minute projection on walls) hasn't changed from years back.There honestly needs to be something else to bring people back.I fear this place is losing visitors, with the exception on mandatory school tours. I really hope they are able to do some changes to entice people to come back.Price isn't the issue, the novelty has worn out for adults as there isn't anything new to take photos of.",84Cerberus84,"Amazing place, worth the visit! Loads of fun.. Sort of stuck out in nowhere’s land so make sure you take a taxi that knows the area(many who don’t in Manila) ",Jodi J,"A 500-peso bill, a camera (nevermind the quality), an hour, and a photographer (or model) are all it takes to fill your memory disk in an hour.   Because every painting and every angle give different glimpse of a story, and  you don't want your audience to miss any of it.  The alternative challenge is to shift into a pose that gives a unique story --- that is a photo that can sell.Entrance fee won't be worth the while for all personalities. For those people who are merely curious and care about the beauty of the work, spare yourself from the queue. It's not worth the photo. You can visit the museum via the internet. The work here is fantastic, but for those who are not into arts, it's too much to absorb in one visit, and you'll end up less appreciative, yawning and grumpy in the later parts of the tour. For artists, many lessons can be gained here. For people, who enjoys grooming their virtual profiles, this is a paradise for you.",Daring Darling,A must-vist place for people who love to take photos. Kids and kids at heart will surely have fun taking pictures for FB and IG and whatevers. Bought our tickets through an online app.  It's cheaper and you'll spend less time at the booth. ,wena_anew,"If you are an art lover, you’ll love it here as you use your imagination to interact with all the 3D artworks.  My son was up to the challenge on how to creatively pose for the artworks however during our visit there were other schools as well making it difficult to get really nice or decent shots.  Hopefully, when we come back there would be fewer people.  Be here on a weekday to enjoy the experience.The art show about Creation was nice but they gave Adam wings which is kind of misleading because that’s not what the Bible says.  Probably, they should recreate it according to the Biblical truth.",Mharl Cua,"This was my sixth trip to Manila, but I had always put Art in Island in the “too far” basket. What a mistake! This is by far the best attraction in town, regardless of your age or interests. It’s a huge facility with so many installations to look at and photograph. There are also some English captions to guide visitors on the background of the artwork and how to best take a picture. The staff were superb, always on hand to help and advise and it never felt rushed or hectic. It’s 500 pesos to enter, and you need to either go barefoot (as we did) or wear the provided slippers. It’s open from 9:30am till 8:30pm every day except Monday. And if you go, I guarantee you’ll have a new profile picture on some site, somewhere, as well as countless photos to share. Highly recommended!",Saul_True,worth the money. spent the whole 4hrs taking pics. I just wished there were filipino artists involved.,Tina L,"For those who like to pose and take pictures, this is a good place to be. This would be good place to visit when it is raining and when you don’t want to spend time outdoors. This is also a good place to go on a super hot day as it is cool inside. Do make sure to go when there are not many people visiting the place. A call to the museum can easily give you that information.also make sure that you have enough battery on your gadgets.",Rhea E,The place is nice and recommended for kids and group of friends.

A must visit for families in Cubao.",Cassandra Yu,This place is a lot of fun to visit with some great pictures to be had best shared with either friends or a loved one!,Jase,Be part of the art - take photos from prescribed viewpoints to become part of the 3-D paintings and sets. Fun to do with older kids and teens as they will understand the concept of perspective and will have fun posing  and taking photos. Admission includes a short but very entertaining laser light show at 11:00 am. Make sure you bring along an extra pair of socks as shoes are not allowed inside the museum.,Darren B,"Me, my mom and my kids enjoyed our visit here. We had so much fun taking pictures in the Island Museum. This is highly recommended specially to foreign nationals who visits the Philippines. Kudos Art In Island!!!",JAASM,"Best time to go is when you have already eaten and will not go hungry for another 5 to 6 hours.Wear a good socks (some socks seems slippery) or buy from them (what they sell is a good souvenir socks).If you are a student, bring your ID.Drink lots of water, to be honest, its tiring but its fun.Bring lots and lots of picture perfect poses and a large memory for your camera.Always find the camera spot and a good angle or find a staff to take your photo, since pictures won't look good if you just point and shoot.And also, make sure you appreciate/immerse in the art when coming here.. they are really good paintings.",zheeby2872

There are restaurants, shops and stores and residential condominiums buildings all within walking distance of each other. A nice way to spend the day shopping, eating and taking a walk with people watching.",Gene P,"I lived here for 8 years and I still love going back to this place. It’s such a happy place for me that I didn’t have to leave the place because it has everything in it. It has a wide selection of restaurants, cafes, bars, and a couple of retail stores, convenience stores, and gyms. The mall hours are a bit late compared to other malls in the metro but I don’t mind because then you have somewhere to go after work even if you’re caught up in traffic. Some of the restaurants are even open 24/7 so you don’t have to worry if you get hungry in the wee hours of the morning.You’ll never get bored in this place because it has so much to offer. You will be amused by the decors for every season/occasion. There are other sorts of entertainment like mini-concerts, live shows, street performers, etc.During typhoons, you won’t ever have to worry since many stores and even the grocery store is open.I have considered this place my 2nd home in Manila and I love going back there every once in a while.",Angeli T,Everything you need are inside the city. This is the best place to shop and dine. I hope that they are earthquake ready.,frank ola,"A vibrant place for wandering aimlessly, cinemas, food and other entertainment. Many street stalls have sprouted up with Christmas items for sale.",RA😎,Smallish mall with some interesting mix of Global and Local brands. Can do with a better mix of eateries but there is a decent Mary Grace and even a Macdonalds in the mall ,Teresa C,"Buildings here are a  mixture of old and new structures. The complex is one of the oldest shopping areas in Metro Manila. In fact there is  a monument honoring call center workers here  since this is the first in the Philippines that hosted BPO offices. The older buildings host mostly dining places and fast food restaurants.The newer infrastructures host call centers, department stores , offices and  grocery stores.The bottom line is this is located near the center of the Metro. It is accessible from the Antipolo, Montalban, Mandaluyong, Rizal and most areas.The only problem here is the traffic during weekends since a major highway (C-5) traverses the area.I suggest be here after lunch so you could park your car effortlessly and wait till sundown to take your dinner here. There are also live bands in the evening. But loud music stops by 10 pm to follow  local ordinances. There is no casino here so this is good for family outlings, like reunion, anniversaries , baptism or weddings.There is an air-conditioned church within the complex. It is ideal of weddings.If you are the religious type, there is another church near the area, a pilgrimage church  for Saint Father Pio believers.It is located near a gasoline station but come early Sunday for parking convenience. The church is crowded but there are flat screens that monitor the masses inside if you could not make it inside the church. So you may take your lunch here since you have only to walk from the church.Everything is here--food, drinks, live band, entertainment, supermarket, cinemas....name it. Or you may rent a condo or a townhouse here. Better buy a unit inside since the entertainment outlets are open until the wee hours of the morning, except that loud noise is banned after 10 pm.",Jolieprincess,"We rented a place managed by Christine Chan, a broker in Eastwood. We stayed in her flat for x number of years, but never got any help with the leaks, clogging drainage, and always broken water pipes. We requested once, but it took us a serious amount of time chasing her, so in our years of stay, we just spent on everything that we need that is supposedly under contract should have been shouldered by the broker-herself/owner. Before we left the place, she told us to repair the parts of the house that we have damaged because they are not part of the expenses she should shoulder based on the contract , and understandably, we hired our own contractor and did the fixing. We did this as she promised to return the deposit if we did; however the same thing that happened to another expat, she just lied and never gave our deposit back! She mentioned that we have damaged more stuff in the house and nothing will be left from our money. The first few weeks we moved to her place, we were so dumb not to double check if everything was OK and working well as we trusted very well, til after a week of stay that we began noticing the clogging commode, leaking pipes, broken sink that we repaired and paid for from our own pockets in the last four years. We left the sink OK and working well, but obviously, she will create stories to not return our money. I am not the only one complaining about this, and there are other reviews about her to attest this. I have receipts of everything we spent to fix her flat, that I have been keeping as proofs that we fixed the flat as many things were broken when we moved in. Too bad. Avoid her at all cost.",Jun Ruaya,The facility is good & the staff are courteous. Numerous shop & restaurants to cater in every niche/interest .,Foxtrot,"There is nothing more comfortable than living in Eastwood City where you can walk, dine, buy groceries, watch live concerts and see a movie all in one place. Should you want to eat or have coffee in the middle of the night or even the wee hours of the morning, you can expect establishments open 24/7 to cater to your cravings. I love how everything is in Eastwood for you to shop or even have your health check-ups.",regidorvillegas,it's quezon city's bgc. the second best city mall. it has hotels and all kinds of restaurants and shops.,Mon C,"just like most Megaworld Developments, Eastwood City looked pretty cool when it opened but now it's all cramped up and congested.

Then they charge the room for 2500 -3000 php. affordable right?. but they will also charge 600 PHP for the parking before you check out. you cant do anything because they will ask for ah 4000 deposit before they will let you check in. AND THEIR CARPET IS SO DIRTY. WHEN MY KID WENT UP THE BED I SAW HIS FEET WAS SO BLACK. SO I LOOK AT MINE FCK IT WAS ALSO SO BLACK. LOOKs LIKE THE CARPET WAS NEVER CLEANED FOR YEARS. i should have taken a photo of it.  This place is my worst hotel experience ever in my whole life.,jamerson tiu,"I was looking for a place to stay near Club Filipino. Our fraternity anniversary could easily spend time till midnight and with the possibility of having some drinks during the fun and fellowship then it would be a better decision for me to stay in a hotel than to drive home to my house 70 kilometres south of Manila. Elan Hotel Modern fits that requirement. Its location is barely a 10-minutes walk to the club. The one thing that doesn’t fit is its name. The hotel is no modern at all in todays world. The rooms although big for the current standards are old in design and features. The air conditioning system albeit cold is quite noisy, the bed  has seen better days and the door lock is still the insert key type. The carpet needs replacement and the bathroom and cabinets are",ynadqnor,"We had our staycation on 01/25/2020 and we choose to get it done at Greenhills Eland New Modern Hotel. We really love the room, it has good view, the bathtub is awesome, the beds were double and the pool area are so great (specially the jacuzzi part) we were the only people whose using it that’s why we love the moments. I could have been perfect if tv has 24 hours cable connection. I would really love to go back again.",Jefferson A,"For people without the usual huge families around during holidays, Elan knows not only to provide engaging events coupled with great food and hospitality, but they also take to heart emulating the very warmth of family in the room where they had us gather together. At the end of the day that stays with us priceless. Long after we've left we will always have how tonight felt like home and family to look back at forever. Elan knows stellar service and excellent love. #ELANderful2020",Robe G,"It is my 3rd time staying at this property and my 3rd reviews for this hotel.  Our room was at the 13th floor and the view is amazing. The room is spacious and clean. Love the multi-function countertop inside the bathroom.  The bed is super comfy and spacious. Wifi inside the room is improving. And most of all, the staffs are very helpful, attentive, accommodating and very patient attending to our needs (through emails and during check-in/check-out).  They say 3rd time is a charm. Indeed it is.",CoCo08,"The room I stayed in was terrible.  The room needs cleaning and it smells like it has just been recently sprayed, maybe for bugs or roaches.  Some parts of the walls, cabinets, and bathroom needed repairs.  The air conditioner needs to be replaced.  Not recommended especially for families.",Roy,"Located right next to the iconic Greenhills Shopping Center, this hotel will most likely be your choice especially foreign shoppers looking for good deals and pearls. The hotel looks dated and, specifically the room I got smelled old. Hotel staff is amazing though.",Lanz Cabrera,Birthday celebrators really had fun. Thanks to our Guest Relations Officer Ms. Nikka for asisting us during our stay. Very convenient for both kids and oldies (because we are with them). Will definitely go back.,Yvn Villaruel,"Staycation with my kids at Elan Hotel was very enjoyable. Hotel staffs are really helpful and approachable, receptionist Jasmine is awesome and so genuine. She really went out of her way to make our stay so comfortable. I never came across a staff as helpful as her, she even helped us on reserving a restaurant where we can eat and she even booked a car service for us not to get lost. Any small problems were dealt with immediately efficiently and always with a smile. Jasmine is a credit and great asset to this hotel as well as her manager Dianne (i met her on the day of our check out). We hope to come back again. The kids also love the breakfast. Such a great stay Thank you Elan!",EliBalaguer,"Most impressive is the size of the room compared to hotel rooms of the same value. It was spacious allowing us to conveniently move about. It’s like a service apartment with a kitchen counter though there are no provisions to cook. At night, from our room on the 37th floor, we enjoyed viewing the city lights. The bathroom though needs a bit of refurbishing since it’s quite old. We were allowed to check-in early without fuss, and check-out was also quick. I’d recommend this hotel for business travellers and families as well. Across the hotel is the famous Greenhills Shopping Center where great bargains can be found!",cabgawtravels,The location is superb. Not as crowdy as Metro Manila. Five minutes walk to Greenhills Mall. Here you have excellent restaurants that not cost a lot but keep very high standard. The Mall here is also more worth visiting due to its not a copy of the super malls around the Philippines. You can find things here as it have a low price market too indoors. Camp Aguinaldo Golf Course and Wack Wack Golf & Country Club is also just a walk away.   Service is excellent with very friendly staff. The restaurant holds a surprisingly high standard. The food is excellent and the service level is top notch. All very clean and tidy.  Rooms was very good indeed. Clean and absolutely fresh.   The view at roof top in the 40 Storey Hotel Residence are awesome. The pool is nice and clean. I wish they,Swe_Viking,"We will definitely go back here for sure!  We stayed here for 2days for the preparation of my Sister's wedding, the place was so relaxing, comfy and very sosyal 😁 The room was clean and well organized. Thank you so much Ms .

 San Juan,Tourist Site,Greenhills Shopping Center,"The crown jewel of the entire Greenhills complex, it has long established itself as a true haven for one-of-a-kind finds and as the go-to mall for specialty categories such as clothing, shoes, pearls, electronics, and more.Read more",Shopping Malls,"Ortigas Avenue, San Juan, Metro Manila, Philippines",0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Oritigas Geenhills Shopping will not answer telephone calls to 63-7210572with the strict lock-down due to pandemic,  few ""essential"" stores are still open. Now less than  10% of usual visitors encountered. In February of 2020 the first 5 cases of Covid-19 in Philippines originated from tourists  who visited there. And there is still a stigma.",lyd,"This is the Philippines answer to Singapore’s SIM LIM.  The place is a bit daunting since it is an actual High-end Mall with brand names and opulence but also connects to a number off floors and different sub buildings which are not shown on their website which are all called the Greenhills Shopping center since all are owned by Ortigas Malls.  As the other reviews mention, the various halls play host to many small makeshift stores selling everything from fake Guccis and Rolexes to real and knock off phones and computers and their repair. Each time I go there, I spend more time looking to find the place I want to go since all these cubicle shops look alike.  I get the feeling there are probably a dozen good repair shops and all the rest serve as middle men doing minor repairs but they serves as middlemen if you need real repairs on you phone or computer.  Also you should expect a little “Puti Tax” since these shops will vary their prices if you look like a foreigner.  Nonetheless, the expansive area can probably offer just about anything you need.  If they do not have something at one store, just ask and they will run to another shop to sell it to you.",Saudi G,"Because of the enhanced quarantine protocols, you must wear a face mask, a face shield and show a quarantine passed issued by the local government to enter the Shopping zone.  People just go to buy groceries nowadays. And it will take 45 minutes to 90 minutes inside the Unimart supermart.Along Ortigas Ave. the 3 lane street @ 1.5 meter wide per lane has been narrowed to 2 lanes for 4 wheeled cars and the 3rd lane for bikes only!. And the road trip time is now longer.  500 meters travel takes about 20-30 minutes Noontime temperature this Sept is 36 degrees Centigrade",c devera,Great mall if you are trying your phone to get fixed or if you are looking for a more affordable but fashionable dress.,travelbud.net,"The whole complex closed since March 16 due to lockdown and quarantine., except UNIMART. I go to buy vitamin/ supplements.  Other locations: Tokyo Tokyo resto, Kenny Rogers resto, and Chowking King and Jollibee and LeChing and halal foods. Ace Hardware, Watsons.",c devera,"I visited Greenhills last February 2020 to shop for winter OOTD clothes for my sister's trip in Japan. The items are really cheaper compared to mall prices. However, one must be very patient to go to every shop in order to look for the cheapest negotibale price. One must also be very meticulous in inspecting for clothes bags or any items before buying to make sure that it is of good quality. Also, be mindful of your personal belongings especially when there are many shoppers. The establishments will not be responsible for any loss. There are also restaurants in the area where you can stop by for snacks, lunch or dinner after shopping. ",uja,"Fascinating place to shop!  Large electronics section with  lots of iPhones and accessories cheap.  They have brand name shoes, clothes and bags. Lovely jewelry, they even had furniture.  I'm not a big shopper and don't care about brand names, but if you want Coach, Gucci, Kate Spade bags they had tons.  Pretty sure they were knock offs but they looked nice.",Elaina L,"This mall represents the old era of malling, a favourite pastime of Filipino families spending their precious bonding moments in an air conditioned building that houses restaurants, retail shops and outlets, boutiques and even a supermarket. It can not be denied however that this mall has lagged behind in terms of modern design, convenience and functionality that is inherent to the present day fashionable and trendsetting style of the newer and modernistic malls in the city. It can be told that it has seen better days. In spite of this disadvantage it still exudes the aura of an old but functional and fun place to visit.",ynadqnor,Shopping in green hills all alone was fun and it's kind of an adventure because there's a lot of pop up store's,Clyde Q,"GSC is still a great place to shop. The variety of wares and restaurants/cafes are such that you won't be satisfied with just a day's visit.Parking is really a problem though, and sometimes the throngs of people whom you have to compete with at that desired watering hole or resto of yours.",Karen G,"Greenhills is large and sells low cost [largely knock offs] goods - shirts, shoes [the Philippines appears obsessed with sports shoes.. you can find all sorts here and i have to say the quality is not too bad!].   But my favorite is the jewellery section - go for the pearls but ensure that you dont get coerced. each shop will tell you that you are their first customer.  As you walk through, you can see which ones offer better quality products. I have been to the shop called AJ-Nor twice and each time the pearls are good stuff.  If anything, you should just go and see it for yourself.  The downside is that it is so packed you need to watch your bags and the toilets are not too nice.  And during peak hours or weekends, you may have to wait a long time for transport!",tumblentumbleweeds58,"Love the new and improved Greenhills Mall. It is a combination of department store style shop owners and lots of kiosks/small stalls they call Tiangge. It reminds me of the QV Market in Melbourne or Paddy’s Market in Sydney and evening similar to Myeongdong in South Korea the go to for cheap souvenirs, cheap fashion, foods, and Knick-Knacks and luxury brand Knock offs. The difference is this particular centre is organised under one roof and inside an air conditioned building so it is pleasant to shop year round wether it rains or shines. It is always hot and humid in the Philippines so I love that I can take my time haggling with vendors in a nice indoor and clean setting. Green Hills has fashion, accessory, toys and packed food items that are perfect to take home by tourists who like the Filipino snacks or returning Filipino nationals who loves to bring back a taste of home. There’s also an array of food choices in the surrounds. There’s a play zone to leave young kids so they can have fun while parents shop without feeling guilty. Filipinos normally would have a nanny with their kids at the play zone and for safety it would probably be best to have someone looking over and not leaving kids on their own. For all sorts of safety reasons.",justcameback2015,"Too many stalls of all the same things, if you want a cheap knockoff bag do you go to the first stall or the 20th stall as they were all selling the same looking ones. If you want cheap stuff place to go but wasn’t what I call nice shopping.",Johanna A,If you are looking for Brand Bags and Shoes ( replica) this is the place you want to shop in affordable price.They also have places to dine and you just have to choose what food do you want to eat.I’ll visit again here next time.,Neen5169,"Maybe one of the best places to shop and test your haggling skills. They have a whole section dedicated to just cellphone and cellphone accessories.  A good place to buy clothes, bags and shoes( lots of knockoff though).",monalizah5486,"Skip this place if you wanted to buy good stuff still better if u go to divisoria or tutuban and makati cinema square for your cellphone accessories. I went to greenhills to buy and trade my phone but ot looks like price here is a lot way expensive than makati cinema square cellphone center, and its too crowded now, store owner here are very intimidating ending of my shopping...not so good and im disappointed for the outcome of my shopping",Rolly,"Availability of different types of merchandise and gifts that the traveler may need at lower prices than other shopping areas, and of acceptable quality, but not of the top qualities.",travelmate,"This place is amazing for shoppers who look for some budget shopping. One gets all kinds of products and large selection of imitations. Most of these products though imitations, seems to be of good quality. While bargain is a absolute must, prices seemed to be standardised across different outlets. But bear in mind, the quality also differs substantially. Such markets are very prevalent in China and other SE Asian countries, but I believe this one is really large and best. Don't forget to visit the mobile market/repair shops in the first floor. Very interesting indeed. At times, the shopkeepers are pushy and rude but it pays to be polite and turn it away. One can spend an hour to a day depending on what one wants. Pearl market seems to be interesting but may not be wise idea to shop without any support from local friend.",202Abdullah,Ah greenhills lots of things you can buy with a cheap price yet a quality product if you're looking for one try to go to greenhills u wouldn't even realize that u forgot what u were looking for but get home with a bunch of shopping bags heheand its quite fun just to window shopping..,SaranathPS,All kind of goods rather cheap often lesser quality and the pearls are popular but don't know if it will be a good buy probably too expensive for low quality or even fake pearls. In general all look bad quality and a lot of fake products !! be alert ! lots of restaurants lots of choice. If you have to kill some time greenhills is an option. Huge area with all kind of goods. Bargain is you like to buy something is the message !,Zarah Jane C

But honestly they need to shut the hotel down until they get their plumbing problems fixed. Immediately the sink was leaking water. They came and fixed it but then the sink started backing up. The most unbelievable issues is they didn’t want you using toilet paper in the toilet. I say what, is this a joke? No Westerner would find that acceptable.

Clean, modern and safe to walk. You can also choose different kind of restaurant that you want to try.",Bradley,"Nothing to to with Pilipino spirit, but definitely amazing what they have built here. Must look like a ghost city during the pandemic ",Elena Ciocan,"The malls and the park here is very relaxing, comparing it to Makati I find this place much better. I love going here to have a walk and enjoy time with friends and family.",travelbud.net,"My first time in Bonifacio on a weekend trip to Manila in Feb 2020. A surprisingly modern place with some decent hotels, restaurants and cocktail bars. Also very easy to walk around, which makes for a nice change from other parts of the city. Really feels like a modern international city here.",KGB777,Very clean and interesting city!  When you're around here you'll forget that you're in a third world country.  Clean and modern with lots of nice shops and restaurants.  Walked around to take note of the amazing mural on some of the buildings.  They were just so fabulous!,luxetrip,"Very clean, suitable for all ages. The place has everything you need, malls, cafes, parks, offices. Wish I live here",AJ I,"BGC is one of the most posh places in Manila. It’s a popular and high-end business district with plenty of business activities and areas for shopping, dining, and entertainment. For posh malling experience, Uptown Bonifacio and The Grand Canal at McKinley Hill are great places. The Grand Canal also has that Italian feel in it and you can enjoy riding the gondola. Market Market and SM Aura are huge malls. Market Market has plenty of options for food, and has plenty of transportation options to other parts of Manila.Bonifacio High Street is an outdoor shopping and dining strip with shops at both side of the pedestrian street which has a relaxing park-like vibe.When you’re in BGC, you’ll feel like you’re transferred into a different world if you entered from the somewhat chaotic environs. Within the business district, electric cables are buried underground, so the city views are orderly. There are green spaces and plenty of high rise buildings.You could also walk from one end of the city to the other, and the air quality is much better compared to most areas in Metro Manila.",Makoto,"High Street in Bonifacio Global City is the place to be when visiting Manila, Taguig City. The pedestrian area, lined with greens and small parks has a nice atmosphere to it. It is a busy place and popular with young people and families. You can safely walk all the way up and down the couple blocks and enjoy the vibe. High street is full of brand stores and restaurants and cafés of any kind. Come here for an afternoon or an evening out with friends and enjoy the delicious foods and buskers. Enjoy the water features and greens and fresh air. ",inhale-exhale321,"An adventurer's mecca. A walkabout Bonifacio GLOBAL City will certainly satisfy your adventure curiosity from High Street, Mid town, Market Market and SM AURA. You will find an eyeful of everything BGC offers its  visitors.  Check it out!",Pasifiku671,"A very well developed place. Clean, safe and cozy. Living here is surely pleasurable and convenient. There are alot of bars to stay at this place and get merry. ",Nico Samneil Sy Salado,High end street - nice place to chill.  A business district with shops where you can find whatever you need from food to clothes. Luxury brand hotels nearby good for staycation with family as well.,Jane S,"My husband and I stay in BGC whenever in Manila, which is almost every year for the last 4 years.  Here you will find first-world accommodation (airbnb or hotel), restaurants, cafes, parks, bars, shopping, banks, services, etc....and yes, just about everything is overpriced compared to other Philippine cities and villages (minus Makati)...but it is the price you pay for seeking first world comforts and standards here. It’s a bit strange to have such a place in a third world (developing) country with typical chaos, poverty and pollution just outside the city limits.  However, we like it because of the safety, sanitation and convenience factor.  It’s also just an easy 20 min away (mb less outside rush hour) from the NAIA terminals where you can fly to any beautiful, peaceful and more authentically Filipino places.",Nancy de Guia,This area has really been built up over the past 10 years. Lots of shops and restaurants. Activities at night. Relatively safe to walk. Good fun. ,mabuhay878,It is great to see a lot of people .. It is great place to have meet up with friends. Lots of restaurants and fun.,LoveToTravel6467,"Place is clean, security is okay. Many shops and restaurants to go to, great place to bring your family and pets.",SaadTowheed,"this is one of the few places in the mess of Manila where you can stroll and have a safe night out.everything is functioning, good and modern infrastructure, safety and cleanlinessgood restaurants, clubs and bars and most important companies have an office there",gabayali,"It's like being in prison because it's so awful outside bgc so you never leave. Has movies, parks, dogs 🐕, supermarkets, restaurants, offices, etc. Why leave...",sauraumpfa,"We dine in Mango tree- the food are good and the staff are courteous.We talk a walk/ stroll, watch people to break life city monotony Of always working.Then take to watch a movie, we also fetch my grandchildren from playing in a designated area in BGC.Good to spend weekends with the family.All of us enjoy, children and adult alike.",pinyinok,"Lots of restaurants, shops, malls and open spaces, great place to hang out with family and friends. Children love it.",Kizomama,"BGC by the name it has, its a definite Global City with the skyscrapers and the Global companies, tidy roads, green lawns etc. except the traffic congestions which everyone locally aware of it. If you take someone who was fall asleep from Manila airport to BGC and he woke up, he wont believe that you are in Manila. He would feel that you took him to the US or some other Global cities.  Worth to look at the city from a skyscraper during night time.  ",Cato K
