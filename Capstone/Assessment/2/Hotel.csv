Hotel Kimberly is not even on my list to  stay, however just for the sake of options, I tried to inquire, they are not the best looking hotel you could find but the staff are friendly and easy to deal with.  I've got the Superior room which is pretty big for what I need. Clean, spacious room and they even bother placing usb charger besides the headboard which is nice.  Checking in during a pandemic makes me worry about cleanliness but they are pretty strict about it. one of their staff even told me to put my mask when I open the door to get my breakfast.

The Superior Room was very spacious and amenities sufficient for my 4 night stay. The daily buffet breakfast was great but the only thing is that the dining area is a little small for hotel of this size. Location wise, it's a short walk to most places.

I've stayed in some challenging places (Eastern Europe, Asia, etc), this one was unacceptable.",Landon014,The hotel is fortunate to have such amazing surroundings yet the poor upkeep of the hotel is a real let down. We had multiple rooms and only one rooms shower worked. Having to all use one shower was not ideal. The aircon hadn‚Äôt been serviced for awhile either.,Ash,After checking into hotel I was told they had no water but could give me a bucket. I found dirty underwear behind a curtain and piles of dust in the corners. There was lubricant on the bed frame and hair in the bed. I contacted Agoda and they were useless - couldn‚Äôt organise a refund.  I‚Äôve had much better experiences with other sites customer care. Don‚Äôt bother with this hotel or Agoda.  I am not a fussy person but in the time of Coronavirus I expect a clean hotel room - shame on them. Would have been good value at $6 a night.,Liam H,"We went for drinks in the bar which has great ambiance. Because virtually all of colonial money was destroyed bu Japanese forces at the end of the war, and also due to American bombardment and artillery, intramuros district provides a glimpse of how Manila looked like when it was one of the jewels in Spanish crown. We had Mai Thai which was expertly made and not too sweet which otherwise spoils this great cocktail.",Las Buganvillas,"Bad comunication: I send email before check in asking about Airport transfer and never got a reply, at check in didn't get any info.

Restaurant: bad food, slow service and expansive  Comfort/service: small and soft bed (linen and towels with holes), bad shower with no pressure and cold water. Old air conditioning. At check in: no liquid soap in dispenser (never refill even after asking), no electricity in 1 of the 2 plugs (fixed by maintenance), no light on the bed side table lamp, no toilet paper. Telephone NOT working.",RobertoM,"I have stayed at this hotel many times. I love the location and the warm feeling I get from the old architecture in this hotel: lots of wood and vintage tiles, reasonably spacious rooms, plush red carpeting on the stairs, etc. However, the rooms just keeps getting more and more run down. Torn towels and small tear in the bed sheet (not a problem). The shower had a mere trickle coming from the shower head. I asked to switch rooms since I was staying for three nights and they kindly obliged but the shower head in the new room only emitted 5 pencil rays of water. These are easy fixes but I get the sense the management does not really care to maintain what should be a jewel in the old city.",cyclingflanman,"Like most of the hotels within Intramuros, White Knight is a bit expensive for its rooms for its tier.

But this hotel is usually booked by persons attending weddings so you might experience a bit of inconvenience from time to time.

Good value, polite staff, especially Angel.",Raechel Donahue,"The location of this hotel is wonderful if you are wanting to see all the old historic sites in Manila.  The cost is also quite reasonable.  My big issue was that in the 5 nights I spent there the room was never cleaned,  No trash taken out, no fresh towels or shampoo,  The WiFi was only functional by the door of the room.  Once you got to the bathroom (about 3 steps in) the WiFi was dead. The WiFi password changes every 24 hours you use it, so you have to get a new password everyday for the spotty WiFi anyway.  In my room they offered a refrigerator, but it was not plugged in, so it was of questionable use.",Daniel D,"Just got back from the Philippines, and I was so pleasantly surprised with just how lovely the decor of this boutique hotel was, with our room having gorgeous French doors to a little walk-out!

This time I found there to be no real difference between the premier room and standard room, the only difference was the floor level, with premier rooms on the 49th floor.

No towels(need to inform that you need a towel) for sure the supervisor or manager was not that strong to supervise if they even have a checklist. Dusty, look old, need detail cleaning and hire more energetic people to be effective . A lot of cheaper hotel with a better service. They have a huge advertisements promo but its subject for availability of the room which is the same as useless.. i will never return again and never recommend for anyone. It feels like you pay and you will be sorry. And there is no any chance of selecting your room or any, they just give you the price with buffet and etc which i didnt request. We are not idiot we just like a bed simple as that, suggestive selling or offer is more helpful and effective.",michaelhagamann,"The staff at the reception was less catering. For example, I was there at 10am, I booked for 1 day. But check in was 1pm and they had asked me to wait or pay for the early check in which is unimaginable it would make sense if I came really early  but not 3 hours earlier. But credit to them when I mentioned this line of thought they actually did let me check in at around  12pm. The rooms were okay I guess for the price I was paying the staff needs more training. since this is a hotel and not an inn. They have to be extra nice in everything. It‚Äôs good for a three star establishment.",Lilith M,"I had a great experience at Eurotel in Cubao (see my other review), so I decided to try another one.

Check-out is fast. The room was clean and cold (aircon worked), not stuffy but no window. The smell of bug spray is noticeable in the ground floor corridor.  Breakfast is a challenge because it is busy and there is no staff monitoring the area. The Buffet is tasty and filling, lots of coffee, but be ready to wait for refills.

I'm a former hotelier and with a rate of just roughly over Php 2000 with free breakfast for 2, I wasn't really expecting so much.  Check-in was ok according to my husband who checked in ahead of me. There was a 2k deposit but we prepared for this. Anyway, I always expect hotels to have a security deposit in place. Goodie if there's none! The elevators are a bit slow so it's not for those who lack patience. But that's only during peak hours, like check-in and check out. We had to ride the elevator up then down because it keeps skipping our floor when going down. The building is old but our room was well-maintained and we had a wonderful view. It was big too. It",niezhining,"What I like about BSA Twin Towers is its location: just across SM Megamall, secondly, each room comes with coffee, water and appliances you'll need to heat up food and cool down drinks. Last, but certainly not the least, I love the rainshower head although the heater in B4705 was wonky; the hot water wasn't constant. It comes out hot then quickly cools off. I also love that the toilet has a bidet for thoroughly cleaning up yourself after pooping and the hotel provides you with dental hygiene kits, shampoo and conditioner. The bath towels were also soft and smelled good.   Breakfast at Cornerstone Cafe needs improvement on variety, taste and preparation. The scrambled egg on the chafing dish was too runny and bland. The ham and sausage on the menu the first time I stayed at BSA.",Dream566459,"If you are on a budget, think twice. You may want to stretch your budget a little and find somewhere else better than BSA.   Pros: - Location. Just across SM Megamall Bldg A entrance - Good view of the metropolis at the higher floors - It's a condotel, has a mini kitchen and dining table in the room - The room was clean and beddings were OK - Hotel staff and guards were courteous and attentive - Free breakfast, wifi, gym, swimming and playground use.  Cons: - Room was very bland and unappealing compared to advertised photos. Looks very basic like any motels in Manila - Room uses a window type aircon. Ours was a bit noisy and annoying but it's cold though. - Lobby and hotel corridors are hot as hell - Had to wait for the elevator for several minutes, either going up/down - No",Unico Roja
